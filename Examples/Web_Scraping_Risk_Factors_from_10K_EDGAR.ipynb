      "['Ri\\nsk Factors\\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of such risks or the risks described below, either alone or taken together, occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\\nOur business plan relies on certain assumptions pertaining to the market for our products that, if incorrect, may\\xa0adversely affect our growth and profitability.\\nWe allocate our design, development, marketing, management and financial resources based on our business plan, which includes assumptions about various demographic trends and trends in the treatment of spine disorders and the resulting demand for our products. However, these trends are uncertain. There can be no assurance that our assumptions with respect to an aging population with broad medical coverage and longer life expectancy, which we expect to lead to increased spinal injuries and degeneration, are accurate. In addition, an increasing awareness and use of non-invasive means for the prevention and treatment of back pain and rehabilitation purposes may\\xa0reduce demand for, or slow the growth of sales of, spine fusion products. A significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of back pain or damaged or diseased bone and tissue could adversely affect demand for some or all of our products. For example, pharmaceutical advances could result in non-surgical treatments gaining more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to spine fusion. The emergence of new biological or synthetic materials to facilitate regeneration of damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged tissue could increasingly minimize or delay the need for spine fusion surgery and provide other biological alternatives to spine fusion. New surgical procedures could diminish demand for some of our products. The increased acceptance of emerging technologies that do not require spine fusion, such as artificial discs and nucleus replacement, for the surgical treatment of spine disorders would reduce demand for, or slow the growth of sales of, spine fusion products. If our assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect or if alternative treatments to those offered by our products gain further acceptance, then demand for our products could be significantly less than we anticipate and we may\\xa0not be able to achieve or sustain growth or profitability.\\nWe are in a highly competitive market segment, face competition from large, well-established medical device companies with significant resources, and may\\xa0not be able to compete effectively.\\nThe market for spine fusion products and procedures is intensely competitive, subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. In 2016, a significant percentage of global spine implant product revenues was generated by Medtronic Sofamor Danek, a subsidiary of Medtronic,\\xa0Inc.; Depuy Spine, a subsidiary of Johnson\\xa0& Johnson; and Stryker Spine. Our competitors also include numerous other publicly-traded and privately-held companies such as NuVasive, Zimmer, Biomet, Globus, K2M Medical and SeaSpine.\\nSeveral of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including:\\n•\\nmore established relationships with spine surgeons;\\n•\\nmore established distribution networks;\\n•\\nbroader spine surgery product offerings;\\n•\\nstronger intellectual property portfolios;\\n•\\ngreater financial and other resources for product research and development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation;\\n•\\ngreater experience in, and resources for, launching, marketing, distributing and selling products;\\n•\\nsignificantly greater name recognition as well as more recognizable trademarks for products similar to the products that we sell;\\n•\\nmore established relationships with healthcare providers and payors;\\n•\\nproducts supported by more extensive clinical data; and\\n•\\ngreater experience in obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product enhancements.\\n15\\nIn addition, at any time our c\\nurrent competitors or other companies may\\xa0develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products, including ones that prove to be superior to our spine surgery produ\\ncts. For these reasons, we may\\xa0not be able to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors. Any such failure could lead us to modify our strategy, lower our prices, increase the commissions we pay on sales of our products and have a s\\nignificant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe sale of our international distribution operations and agreements will reduce our revenue, and we may not be successful in executing on our business strategy to solely focus on the U.S. marketplace.\\nPrior to the sale of our International operations in September 2016, our international revenue represented approximately 35% of our total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015. Following the closing of the Globus Transaction, our revenues have been and will continue to be materially reduced as we will no longer be generating the same level of revenue from the operations and assets sold in the transaction. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the Globus Transaction will be sufficient for us to grow our U.S. business.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, our future growth will depend on our ability to successfully implement our strategy to focus solely on the U.S. marketplace.\\xa0\\xa0If we are unable to successfully execute on this business strategy or otherwise compete effectively within the U.S. marketplace, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\\nWe\\xa0may\\xa0face\\xa0indemnity\\xa0and\\xa0other\\xa0liability\\xa0claims\\xa0pursuant\\xa0to\\xa0the Globus Purchase and Sale Agreement.\\nUnder the purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our international business to Globus, we are obligated to indemnify Globus against damages arising from, among other things, breaches of our representations, warranties or obligations under the agreement and liabilities not assumed by Globus. The indemnification period generally runs for a period of 18 months from the Closing, with longer survival periods for certain specified representations and warranties. Our indemnification obligations are subject to a deductible in certain cases of $500,000, and our aggregate liability under such indemnification claims is generally limited to $12.0 million, $20.0 million for certain specified representations and warranties, and the full purchase price for breaches of certain specified representations and warranties, breaches of covenants and certain other matters.\\xa0If Globus makes an indemnification claim, we may incur liability and/or expenses, which could harm our operating results. In addition, such indemnity claims may divert management attention from our continuing business.\\nA significant percentage of our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems that include polyaxial pedicle screws.\\nNet sales of our systems that include polyaxial pedicle screws represented approximately 52% and 50% of our net sales for 2017 and 2016, respectively. A decline in sales of these systems, due to lower market demand, the introduction by a third party of a competitive product, an intellectual property dispute involving these systems, or otherwise, would have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of the technology related to our polyaxial pedicle screw systems is licensed to us. Any action that would prevent us from manufacturing, marketing and selling our polyaxial pedicle screw systems would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur sales and marketing efforts are largely dependent upon third parties, many of which are free to market products that compete with our products.\\nMany of our independent distributors also market and sell the products of our competitors, and those competitors may\\xa0have the ability to influence the products that our independent distributors choose to market and sell. Our competitors may\\xa0be able, by offering higher commission payments or otherwise, to convince our independent distributors to terminate their relationships with us, carry fewer of our products or reduce their sales and marketing efforts for our products.\\nIf pricing pressures cause us to decrease prices for our goods and services and we are unable to compensate for such reductions through changes in our product mix or reductions to our expenses, our results of operations will suffer.\\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience decreasing prices for our goods and services we offer due to pricing pressure exerted by our customers in response to increased cost containment efforts from managed care organizations and other third-party payors and increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates. If we are unable to offset such price reductions through changes in our product mix or reductions in our expenses, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\\n16\\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince the spine surgeon community that our products are an attractive al\\nternative to our competitors’ products. If the spine surgeon community does not use our products, our sales will decline and we will be unable to increase our sales and generate profits.\\nIn order for us to sell our products, surgeons must be convinced that our products are superior to competing products. Acceptance of our products depends on educating the spine surgeon community as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to our competitors’ products and on training surgeons in the proper application of our products. If we are not successful in convincing the spine surgeon community of the merit of our products, our sales will decline and we will be unable to increase or achieve and sustain growth or profitability.\\nThere is a learning process involved for spine surgeons to become proficient in the use of our products. Although most spine surgeons may\\xa0have adequate knowledge on how to use most of our products based on their clinical training and experience, we believe that the most effective way to introduce and build market demand for our products is by directly training spine surgeons in the use of our products. If surgeons are not properly trained, they may\\xa0misuse or ineffectively use our products. This may\\xa0also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe must retain the current distributors of our products and attract new distributors of our products.\\nWe plan to increase our network of independent distributors. The establishment and development of a broader distribution network may\\xa0be expensive and time consuming. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may\\xa0be unable to recruit or retain additional qualified independent distributors. Often, our competitors enter into distribution agreements with independent distributors that require such distributors to exclusively sell the products of our competitors. Further, we may\\xa0not be able to enter into agreements with independent distributors on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we do enter into agreements with additional independent distributors, it often takes 90 to 120 days for new distributors to reach full operational effectiveness and such distributors may\\xa0not generate revenue as quickly as we expect them to, commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our products or ultimately be successful in selling our products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if we do not retain our existing independent distributors and attract new, additional independent distributors or if the marketing and sales efforts of our independent distributors and our own direct sales representatives are unsuccessful.\\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply our products. Any problems experienced by any of these manufacturers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our products to us until such manufacturer cures the problem or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of supply.\\nWe rely on third party suppliers for the manufacture of our implants and instruments. We currently rely on a limited number of third party suppliers and any prolonged disruption in the operations of our third party suppliers could have a significant negative impact on our ability to supply our products to customers and to perform our obligations under the Supply Agreement with Globus, and would cause us to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed coverage under our manufacturer’s insurance policies. Events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, fire, sabotage or business accidents could have a significant negative impact on our operations by disrupting our product development and commercialization efforts until such third-party supplier can repair its facility or put in place third-party contract manufacturers to assume this manufacturing role, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer or the re-verification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop products or supply products to customers in a timely manner. Any disruption in the manufacture of our products by our third party suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe depend on various third-party suppliers, and in one case a single third-party supplier, for key raw materials used in the manufacturing processes for our products and the loss of any of these third-party suppliers, or their inability to supply us with adequate raw materials, could harm our business.\\nWe use a number of raw materials, including titanium, titanium alloys, stainless steel, PEEK, and human tissue. We rely from time to time on a number of suppliers and in one case on a single source vendor, Invibio. We have a supply agreement with Invibio, pursuant to which it supplies us with PEEK, a biocompatible plastic that we use in some of our spacers. Invibio is one of a limited number of companies approved to distribute PEEK in the U.S. for use in implantable devices. During 2017 and 2016, approximately 19% and 20% of our revenues were derived from products manufactured using PEEK, respectively.\\n17\\nWe depend on a limited number of sources of human tissue for use in our biologics products, and any failure to obtain tissue from these sources or to have the tissue processed by these entities for us in a timely manner will interfere\\nwith our ability to meet demand for our biologics products effectively. The processing of human tissue into biologics products is labor intensive and it is therefore difficult to maintain a steady supply stream. In addition, due to seasonal changes in mort\\nality rates, some scarce tissues used for our biologics products are at times in particularly short supply. We cannot be certain that our supply of human tissue from our current suppliers and our current inventory of biologics products will be available at\\ncurrent levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs.\\nOur dependence on a single third-party PEEK supplier and the challenges we may\\xa0face in obtaining adequate supplies of biologics products involve several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. In addition, any supply interruption in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material, such as PEEK or human tissue, could materially harm the ability of our third party manufacturers to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. We may\\xa0be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur tissue-based products and related technologies could become subject to significantly greater regulation by the FDA, which could disrupt our business.\\nThe FDA\\xa0regulates human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products or HCT/Ps, but the extent to which they are regulated depends on how they are manufactured and used and whether they meet other criteria for minimal regulation. These criteria include but are not limited to the use of the\\nHCT/Ps for homologous use only and minimal manipulation of the HCT/Ps. These\\nHCT/Ps are regulated by the FDA solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and are referred to as “Section 361 HCT/Ps,” while other HCT/Ps are subject to FDA’s regulatory requirements applicable to\\nmedical devices or biologics. Section 361 HCT/Ps do not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, licensure of a biologics license application, or BLA, or other premarket authorization from FDA before marketing. We believe our HCT/Ps are regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, and therefore, we have not sought or obtained 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, or licensure through a BLA. The FDA could disagree with our determination that our tissue-based products are Section 361 HCT/Ps and could determine that these products are biologics requiring a BLA or medical devices requiring 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, and could require that we cease marketing such products and/or recall them pending appropriate clearance, approval or license from the FDA\\n. If the FDA determines that any of our current or future products contain HCT/Ps that do not meet the\\ncriteria for regulation as a Section 361 HCT/P\\n, it could subject some of our products to additional review and regulatory oversight. If this were to happen, further distribution of the affected products could be interrupted for a substantial period of time, which would reduce our revenues and hurt our profitability.\\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA’s quality system and good tissue practice regulations, the manufacture of our products could be delayed.\\nWe and our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA’s QSR, which covers, among other things, the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, record keeping, storage and shipping of our products. In addition, suppliers and processors of products derived from HCT must comply with the FDA’s current good tissue practice requirements, or cGTPs, which govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the manufacture of HCT/Ps, record keeping and the establishment of a quality program. The FDA audits compliance with the QSR and cGTPs through inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. If we or our suppliers have significant non-compliance issues or if any corrective action plan is not sufficient, we or our suppliers could be forced to halt the manufacture of our products until such problems are corrected to the FDA’s satisfaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. Any recall or FDA requirement demanding that we seek additional approvals or clearances could result in delays, costs associated with modification of a product, loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the FDA, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n18\\nHealthcare policy changes, including recent federal legislation to reform the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.\\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, limit the acceptance and availability of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\\nAn expansion in government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business and results of operations, possibly materially.\\nThe demand for products and the prices at which customers and patients are willing to pay for our products depend upon the ability of our customers to obtain adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for their purchases of our products.\\nSales of our products depend in part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental and private payors. In the U.S., healthcare providers that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors, principally Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to pay for all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the use of our products. In addition, several million individuals were able to purchase health insurance in 2014 for the first time through health insurance \"exchanges\" established under the ACA. While procedures using our currently marketed products are eligible for reimbursement in the U.S., if surgical procedures utilizing our products are performed on an outpatient basis, it is possible that private payors may no longer provide reimbursement for the procedures using our products without further supporting data on the procedure. Any delays in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, adequate coverage or reimbursement for procedures using our products could significantly affect the acceptance of our products and have a significant adverse effect on our business. Additionally, third-party payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products. Our business would be negatively impacted if there are any changes that reduce reimbursement for our products.\\nFurthermore, healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to contain these costs. Several such proposals were enacted as part of ACA, and include numerous provisions to limit Medicare spending through reductions in various fee schedule payments and sweeping payment reforms. Other federal and state cost-control measures include prospective payment systems, capitated rates, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring pre-authorizations or second opinions prior to major surgery, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. Some healthcare providers in the U.S. have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. Healthcare providers may also attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures or by requiring the use of the least expensive devices possible. These cost-control methods also potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical technology exists among all these payors. Therefore, coverage of and reimbursement for medical technology can differ significantly from payor to payor. The continuing efforts of third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside or outside the U.S., to contain or reduce these costs, combined with closer scrutiny of such costs, could restrict our customers’ ability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from these third-party payors. The cost containment measures contained in ACA and other measures being considered at the federal and state level, as well as internationally, could harm our business by adversely affecting the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell our products.\\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create new companies with greater market power, including hospitals. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense. This in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\\n19\\nWe may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, health\\ninformation privacy and security, and disclosure laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors for our products or the procedures in which our products are used, healthcare regulation by federal and state governments significantly impacts our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse, health information privacy and security, and disclosure laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\\n•\\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as state analogs, which constrains our marketing practices and those of our independent sales agents and distributors, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers by prohibiting, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal (or state or commercial) healthcare program (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\\n•\\nthe federal ban, as well as state analogs, on physician self-referrals, which prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity;\\n•\\nfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\\n•\\nHIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\\n•\\nthe state and federal laws “sunshine” provisions that require detailed reporting and disclosures to CMS and applicable states of any payments or “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other health care providers, and for certain states prohibit some forms of these payments, require the adoption of marketing codes of conduct, require the reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information and constrain relationships with physicians and other referral sources;\\n•\\nstate laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts;\\n•\\nthe Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA, specifically, privacy and security provisions including recent amendments under HITECH which impose stringent restrictions on uses and disclosures of protected health information such as for marketing or clinical research purposes and impose significant civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance and require the reporting of breaches to affected individuals, the government and in some cases the media in the event of a violation; and\\n•\\na variety of state-imposed privacy and data security laws which require the protection of information beyond health information, such as employee information or any class of information combining name with state issued identification numbers, social security numbers, credit card, bank or other financial information and which require reporting to state officials in the event of breach or violation and which impose both civil and criminal penalties.\\nACA includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them.\\nIf our past or present operations, or those of our independent sales agents and distributors are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if the healthcare providers, sales agents, distributors or other entities with which we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the Courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.\\n20\\nThe sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government agencies, and we believe that this trend will continue. For examp\\nle, on March 26, 2013 the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert entitled \"Physician-Owned Entities\" related to physician-owned distributors, or PODS.\\nSince 2013, the OIG has further increased its scrutiny of PODs and the Department of Justice has brought severa\\nl high profile cases against physician owners\\n. Prosecutorial scrutiny and governmental oversight over some major device companies regarding the retention of healthcare professionals as consultants has affected and may continue to affect the manner in which\\nmedical device companies may retain healthcare professionals as consultants.\\nAny\\nprecautions we take to detect and prevent noncompliance with applicable laws may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.\\nAny action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant\\nlegal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.\\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or modifications to our products, our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer.\\nOur medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of most new medical devices only after the devices have received clearance under Section\\xa0510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k), or are the subject of an approved premarket approval application, or a PMA. The 510(k) process generally takes three to nine months, but can take significantly longer, especially if the FDA requires a clinical trial to support the 510(k) application.\\xa0\\xa0Currently, we do not know whether the FDA will require clinical data in support of any 510(k)s that we intend to submit for other products in our pipeline. In addition, the FDA continues to re-examine its 510(k) clearance process for medical devices and published several draft guidance documents that could change that process. Any changes that make the process more restrictive could increase the time it takes for us to obtain clearances or could make the 510(k) process unavailable for certain of our products. A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process or is not exempt from premarket review by the FDA. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing and control data and proposed labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA process is more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process, and generally takes between one and three years, if not longer. In addition, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA.\\nModifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k).\\xa0\\xa0Our commercial distribution and marketing of any products or product modifications that we develop will\\xa0be delayed until regulatory clearance or approval is obtained. In addition, because we cannot assure you that any new products or any product modifications we develop will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, the regulatory approval process for our new p\\nroducts or product modifications may\\xa0take significantly longer than anticipated. There is no assurance that the FDA will not require a new product or product modification to go through the lengthy and expensive PMA approval process. The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\\n•\\nour inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that our products are safe or effective for their intended uses;\\n•\\nthe disagreement of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design or implementation of our clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\\n•\\nserious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials;\\n•\\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;\\n21\\n•\\no\\nur inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device\\noutweigh the risks;\\n•\\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; or\\n•\\nthe potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval.\\nDelays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals may:\\n•\\ndelay or prevent commercialization of products we develop;\\n•\\nrequire us to perform\\xa0costly tests or studies;\\n•\\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise have obtained; and\\n•\\nreduce our ability to collect revenues.\\nTo date, all of our non-biologic medical device products that have required FDA review that are being sold in the U.S. have been cleared through the 510(k) process without any required clinical trials. However, the FDA may require clinical data in support of any future 510(k)s or PMAs that we intend to submit for products in our pipeline. We have limited experience in performing clinical trials that might be required for a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. If any of our products require clinical trials, the commercialization of such products could be delayed which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe safety of our products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data and may\\xa0therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought.\\nWe obtained clearance to offer all of our current non-biologic medical device products through the 510(k) route. The ability to obtain a 510(k) clearance is generally based on the FDA’s agreement that a new product is substantially equivalent to certain already marketed products. Because most 510(k)-cleared products were not the subject of pre-market clinical trials, surgeons may\\xa0be slow to adopt our 510(k)-cleared products, we may\\xa0not have the comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may\\xa0be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. With the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, funds have been appropriated for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Healthcare Research and Quality to conduct comparative effectiveness research to determine the effectiveness of different drugs, medical devices, and procedures in treating certain conditions and diseases. Some of our products or procedures performed with our products could become the subject of such research. It is unknown what effect, if any, this research may have on our business. Further, future research or experience may\\xa0indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes or improves patient outcomes less than we initially expect. Such results would reduce demand for our products and this could cause us to withdraw our products from the market. Moreover, if future research or experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to significant legal lia\\nbility, significant negative publicity, damage to our reputation and a dramatic reduction in sales of our products, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nFailure to comply with pos\\nt-marketing regulatory requirements could subject us to enforcement actions, including substantial penalties, and might require us to recall or withdraw a product from the market.\\nOnce a medical device is cleared or approved, a manufacturer must notify the FDA of any modifications to the device. Any modification to a device that has received FDA clearance that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires premarket clearance or possibly approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination in the first instance regarding whether a modification to a cleared or approved device necessitates the filing of a new 510(k) notification or PMA supplement. The FDA may review any manufacturer\\'s decision and can disagree. If the FDA disagrees with any future determination by us that a new clearance or approval is not required, we may need to cease marketing or to recall the modified product un\\ntil and unless we obtain clearance or approval. In addition, we could also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Any of these outcomes would harm our business.\\n22\\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have become more str\\ningent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to continue or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs, or lower than anticipated sales. Even after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval t\\no market a product, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and applicable foreign laws and regulations. The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent,\\nlimit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law.\\xa0\\xa0The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of devices and spur inn\\novation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear. The FDA, state and foreign regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or\\nif we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:\\n•\\nuntitled letters or warning letters;\\n•\\nfines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\\n•\\nrecalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention, or seizure of our products;\\n•\\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;\\n•\\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\\n•\\nd\\nelays in or refusal to grant our requests for future 510(k) clearances, PMA approvals or foreign regulatory approvals of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;\\n•\\nwithdrawals or suspensions of current 510(k) clearances or PMAs or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products;\\n•\\nFDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and/ or\\n•\\ncriminal prosecution.\\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad.\\xa0\\xa0For example, certain policies of the new Presidential administration may impact our business and industry.\\xa0\\xa0Namely, the new Presidential administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications.\\xa0\\xa0Notably, on January 23, 2017, the new Presidential administration ordered a hiring freeze for all executive departments and agencies, including the FDA, which prohibits the FDA from filling employee vacancies or creating new positions.\\xa0\\xa0Under the terms of the order, the freeze will remain in effect until implementation of a plan to be recommended by the Director for the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to reduce the size of the federal workforce through attrition. An under-staffed FDA could result in delays in FDA’s responsiveness or in its ability to review submissions or applications, issue regulations or guidance, or implement or enforce regulatory requirements in a timely fashion or at all.\\xa0\\xa0Moreover, on January 30, 2017, the new Presidential administration issued an Executive Order, applicable to all executive agencies, including the FDA, that requires that for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law.\\xa0\\xa0These requirements are referred to as the “two-for-one” provisions. This Executive Order includes a budget neutrality provision that requires the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances.\\xa0\\xa0For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the Executive Order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation and approximate the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.\\xa0\\xa0In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB on February 2, 2017, the administration indicates that the “two-for-one” provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, on February 24, 2017, the new Presidential administration issued an executive order directing each affected agency to designate an agency official as\\xa0\\xa0a “Regulatory Reform Officer” and establish\\xa0\\xa0a “Regulatory Reform Task Force” to implement the two-for-one provisions and other previously issued executive orders relating to the review of federal regulations, however it is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA’s ability to exercise its regulatory authority.\\xa0\\xa0If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\\n23\\nIf we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may\\xa0be unable to complete these acquisitions or successfully integrate them in\\na cost-effective and non-disruptive manner.\\nOur success depends in part\\xa0on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offering in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures and technologies and our ability to increase our market share. Accordingly, we have pursued and intend to pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves. We do not know if we will be able to successfully complete any acquisitions, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology into our business or retain any key personnel, suppliers or distributors. Our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time consuming, disrupt our ongoing business and distract management. If we are unable to integrate any future or recently acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. For example, an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize significant amounts of expenses, including non-cash acquisition costs, and acquired assets.\\nWe may\\xa0not be able to timely develop new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market.\\nWe sell our products in a market that is characterized by technological change, product innovation, evolving industry standards, competing patent claims, patent litigation and intense competition. Our success will depend in part\\xa0on our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements or modifications to our existing products, which we will need to do before our competitors do so and in a manner that does not infringe issued patents of third parties from which we do not have a license. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop or market new, improved or modified products, or that any of our future products will be accepted by even the surgeons who use our current products. Our competitors’ product development capabilities could be more effective than our capabilities, and their new products may\\xa0get to market before our products. In addition, the products of our competitors may be more effective or less expensive than our products. The introduction of new products by our competitors may lead us to have price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share and may\\xa0render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. The success of any of our new product offerings or enhancement or modification to our existing products will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n•\\nproperly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs;\\n•\\ndevelop new products or enhancements in a timely manner;\\n•\\nobtain the necessary regulatory approvals for new products or product enhancements;\\n•\\nprovide adequate training to potential users of new products;\\n•\\nreceive adequate reimbursement approval of third-party payors such as Medicaid, Medicare and private insurers; and\\n•\\ndevelop an effective marketing and distribution network.\\nDeveloping products in a timely manner can be difficult, in particular because product designs change rapidly to adjust to third-party patent constraints and to market preferences. As a result, we may\\xa0experience delays in our product launches which may\\xa0significantly impede our ability to enter or compete in a given market and may\\xa0reduce the sales that we are able to generate from these products. We may\\xa0experience delays in any phase of a product launch, including during research and development, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and the surgeon training process. In addition, our suppliers of products or components can suffer similar delays, which could cause delays in our product introductions. If we do not develop new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these new products or enhancements, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe are dependent on our senior management team, sales and marketing team, engineering team and key surgeon advisors, and the loss of any of them could harm our business.\\nOur continued success depends in part\\xa0upon the continued availability and contributions of our senior management, sales and marketing team and engineering team and the continued participation of our key surgeon advisors. While we have entered into employment agreements with all members of our senior management team, none of these agreements guarantees the services of the individual for a specified period of time. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately prepare for future turnover of our senior management team. Our ability to grow or at least maintain our sales levels depends in large part\\xa0on our ability to attract and retain sales and marketing personnel and for these sales people to maintain their relationships with surgeons directly and through our distributors. We rely on our engineering team to research, design and develop potential products for our product pipeline. We also rely on our surgeon advisors to advise us on our products, our product pipeline, long-term scientific planning, research and development and industry trends. We compete for personnel and advisors with other companies and other organizations, many of which are larger and have greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we do. We recently implemented numerous changes in our\\n24\\nmanagement team, including in the roles of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, People & Culture, and General Cou\\nnsel, which could have an adverse effect on our retention of our employees, advisors and distributors.\\xa0\\xa0Changes to our senior management team, sales and marketing team, engineering team and key surgeon advisors, or our inability to attract or retain other\\nqualified personnel or advisors, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\\nCompliance with laws and regulations and standards for accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure is time consuming and results in significant expenses.\\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,\\xa0\\xa0The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, other SEC regulations, NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules, and new accounting pronouncements create uncertainty and additional complexities for companies such as ours.\\xa0\\xa0Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\\xa0\\xa0Moreover these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly.\\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, we could be unable to provide timely and accurate financial information and therefore be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Global Select Market, an investigation by the SEC, and civil or criminal sanctions. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting would place us at increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and could cause our stockholders, lenders, suppliers and others to lose confidence in the accuracy or completeness of our financial reports.\\xa0\\xa0This, in turn could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, credit card information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, viruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error or malfeasance, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, fire, flood, other natural disasters, power loss, computer systems failure, data network failure, Internet failure, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such attack, virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA, government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also interrupt our operations, including our ability to bill our customers, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\\nNearly all of our operations are currently conducted in locations that may\\xa0be at risk of damage from fire, earthquakes or other natural disasters.\\nWe currently conduct nearly all of our development and management activities in Carlsbad, California near known wildfire areas and earthquake fault zones. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities, including obtaining property and casualty insurance, and implementing health and safety protocols. We have developed an information technology disaster recovery plan. However, any future natural disaster, such as a fire or an earthquake, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or inventory and cause us to incur additional expenses. A disaster could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our facilities would be difficult to replace and would require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The insurance we maintain against earthquakes, fires, and other natural disasters would not be adequate to cover a total loss of our facilities, may\\xa0not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case and may\\xa0not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\\n25\\nAlphatec Holdings is a holding company with no operations, and unless it receives dividends or other payme\\nnts from its subsidiaries, it will be unable to fulfill its cash obligations.\\nAs a holding company with no business operations, Alphatec Holdings’ material assets consist only of the common stock of its subsidiaries, dividends and other payments received from time to time from its subsidiaries, and the proceeds raised from the sale of debt and equity securities. Alphatec Holdings’ subsidiaries are legally distinct from Alphatec Holdings and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to Alphatec Holdings. Alphatec Holdings will have to rely upon dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to fulfill its cash obligations. Alphatec Holdings may\\xa0not be able to access cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill cash commitments. The ability of Alphatec Spine to make dividend and other payments to Alphatec Holdings is subject to the availability of funds after taking into account its subsidiaries’ funding requirements, the terms of its subsidiaries’ indebtedness and applicable state laws.\\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer.\\nWe will continue to pursue growth in the number of surgeons using our products, the types of products we offer and the geographic regions where our products are sold. Such anticipated growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these anticipated growth activities. We are currently focused on increasing the size and effectiveness of our sales force and distribution network, marketing activities, research and development efforts, inventory management systems, management team and corporate infrastructure. If we do not manage our anticipated growth effectively, the quality of our products, our relationships with physicians, distributors and hospitals, and our reputation could suffer, which would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We must attract and retain qualified personnel and third-party distributors and manage and train them effectively. Personnel qualified in the design, development, production and marketing of our products are difficult to find and hire, and enhancements of information technology systems to support our growth are difficult to implement. We will also need to carefully monitor and manage our surgeon services, our third-party manufacturing resources, quality assurance and efficiency, and the quality assurance and efficiency of our suppliers and distributors. This managing, training and monitoring will require allocation of valuable management resources and significant expense. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.\\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results, Credit and Certain Financial Obligations and Need for Financing\\nWe may\\xa0need to raise additional funds in the future and such funds may\\xa0not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\\nAt December 31, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of $22.5 million and accounts receivable, net of $14.8 million.\\xa0\\xa0Together with the proceeds of our $45.2 million private placement and up to $4.8 million warrant financing in March 2018, we currently estimate this will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months.\\nWe may seek additional funds from public and private equity or debt financings, borrowings under new debt facilities or other sources to fund our projected operating requirements. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\\n•\\nthe payments due in connection with the settlement of the Orthotec matter;\\n•\\nthe revenues generated by sales of our products;\\n•\\nthe costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\\n•\\nthe expenses that we incur from the manufacture of our products by third parties and that we incur from selling our products;\\n•\\nthe costs of developing new products or technologies;\\n•\\nthe cost of obtaining and maintaining FDA or other regulatory approval or clearance for our products and products in development;\\n•\\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights;\\n•\\nthe number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\\n•\\nthe costs and any payments we may make related to our pending litigation matters;\\n26\\n•\\nthe costs associated with increased capital expenditures; and\\n•\\nthe costs associated with our employee retention programs and related benefits.\\nAs a result of these factors, we may need to raise additional funds and such funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. However, under the securities purchase agreement we entered into in connection with March 2018 private placement, we are prohibited from issuing or entering into any agreement to issue any shares of our common stock or other securities, subject to certain permitted exceptions, until the later of (a) 90 days after the effective date of the resale registration statement we are required to file registering the resale of the shares of common stock issued or issuable in the private placement or (b) the date of stockholder approval of the March 2017 private placement.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, rules and regulations of the SEC may restrict our ability to conduct certain types of financing activities, or may affect the timing of and the amounts we can raise by undertaking such activities. For example, under current SEC regulations, at any time during which the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or our public float, is less than $75 million, the amount that we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using one or more registration statements on Form S-3 will be limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. As of March 2, 2018, our public float was $41 million.\\nIn addition, pursuant to the resale registration statement we filed and plan to file in connection with our private placement in March 2018 private placement, and our acquisition of SafeOp, the issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\\nFurthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may\\xa0experience dilution and the new equity or debt securities may\\xa0have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may\\xa0be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may\\xa0not be able to repay debt or other liabilities, develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals and have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nIf we default on our obligations to make settlement payments to Orthotec LLC, the amounts due under the settlement agreements accelerate and become due and payable.\\nAny default of our payment obligation under the settlement agreements we entered into with Orthotec LLC, or Orthotec, would give Orthotec the right to declare all of the future payments to be immediately payable.\\xa0As of March\\xa02, 2018, the outstanding amount to be paid to Orthotec through January 2024 including future interest was $24.9 million.\\xa0If acceleration of payments occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\nWe have a history of net losses, we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\nWe have typically incurred net losses from our continuing operations since our inception. As of December\\xa031, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $459.5 million. We have incurred significant net losses since inception and have relied on our ability to fund our operations through revenues from the sale of our products, equity financings and debt financings. As we have incurred losses, successful transition to profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. This may not occur and, unless and until it does, we will continue to need to raise additional capital.\\xa0\\xa0We may seek additional funds from public and private equity or debt financings, borrowings under new debt facilities or other sources to fund our projected operating requirements.\\xa0 However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain further financing, or do so on reasonable terms. If we are unable to raise additional funds on a timely basis, or at all, we would be materially adversely affected.\\n27\\nWe may be unable to comply with the covenants of our credit facilities.\\nWe must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, in our Amended Credit Facility and affirmative and negative covenants under the Globus Facility Agreement. We failed to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio for January and June 2016, the fixed charge coverage ratio, senior leverage ratio and total leverage ratio covenants for March 2016, and the fixed charge coverage ratio and total leverage ratio covenants for April and May 2016, under our Amended Credit Facility. We also did not meet a minimum requirement for the percentage of our total cash held in U.S. accounts for January, February, March, April, May and June 2016. MidCap and Deerfield, pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement which has been terminated, provided waivers with respect to our non-compliance during such periods. There can be no assurance that at all times in the future we will satisfy all such financial or other covenants of the Amended Credit Facility or the Globus Facility Agreement, or obtain any required waiver or amendment, in which event of default the lenders party to the Amended Credit Facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and MidCap and/or Globus could require all amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility and/or the Globus Facility Agreement, respectively, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition to allowing the lenders to accelerate the loan, several events of default under the Amended Credit Facility or Globus Facility Agreement, such as our failure to make required payments of principal and interest and the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, could require us to pay interest at a rate which is up to five percentage points higher than the interest rate effective immediately before the event of default.\\nAn event of default under the Amended Credit Facility or the Globus Facility Agreement could have a material adverse effect on us. Upon an event of default, if the lenders under the Amended Credit Facility or Globus Facility Agreement accelerate the repayment of all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interest and other fees, or if the lenders elect to charge us additional interest, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash available to repay the amounts due, and we may be forced to seek to amend the terms of the Amended Credit Facility or the Globus Facility Agreement or obtain alternative financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\\nIn addition, if we fail to pay amounts when due under the Amended Credit Facility or the Globus Facility Agreement or upon the occurrence of another event of default, the lenders under the Amended Credit Facility or the Globus Facility Agreement could proceed against the collateral granted to them pursuant to the MidCap Amended Credit Facility and the Globus Facility Agreement. We have granted to the lenders under the Amended Credit Facility a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, including all accounts receivable and all securities evidencing our interests in our subsidiaries, as collateral under the Amended Credit Facility. We have granted Globus under the Globus Facility Agreement a first lien security interest in substantially all of our assets, other than accounts receivable and related assets, which will secure the Globus Facility Agreement on a second lien basis. If Globus proceeds against the collateral, such assets would no longer be available for use in our business, which would have a significant adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur quarterly financial results could fluctuate significantly.\\nOur quarterly financial results are difficult to predict and may\\xa0fluctuate significantly from period to period, particularly because our sales prospects are uncertain. The level of our revenues and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors:\\n•\\nacceptance of our products by surgeons, patients, hospitals and third-party payors;\\n•\\ndemand and pricing of our products;\\n•\\nthe mix of our products sold, because profit margins differ among our products;\\n•\\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\\n•\\nour ability to grow and maintain a productive sales and marketing organization and independent distributor network;\\n•\\nregulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may\\xa0offer or those of our competitors;\\n•\\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\\n•\\nlevels of third-party reimbursement for our products;\\n•\\ninterruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\\n•\\nour ability to produce or obtain products of satisfactory quality or in sufficient quantities to meet demand; and\\n•\\nchanges in our ability to obtain FDA, state and international approval or clearance for our products.\\n28\\nIn addition, until we have a larger base of surgeons using our products, occasional fluctuations in the use of our products by individual surgeons or small groups of surgeons will have a proportionately larger impact\\non our revenues than for companies with a larger customer base.\\nMany of the products we may\\xa0seek to develop and introduce in the future will require FDA approval or clearance. We cannot begin to commercialize any such products in the U.S. without FDA approval or clearance. As a result, it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty. We cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period. Any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by our stockholders or by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period.\\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property Regulatory Penalties and Litigation\\nIf our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products, we may\\xa0lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights of the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may\\xa0not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. For example, we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, may\\xa0deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if any, may\\xa0not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form\\xa0that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the PTO. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. Our issued patents and those that may\\xa0be issued in the future could subsequently be successfully challenged by others and invalidated or rendered unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing and selling related products. In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents.\\nBoth the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Competitors may\\xa0be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable to our products but fall outside of the scope of our patent protection. Although we have entered into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with certain of our employees, consultants and advisors as one of the ways we seek to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary technology, such agreements may\\xa0not be enforceable or may\\xa0not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements. In the event a competitor infringes upon one of our patents or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents and rights may\\xa0be difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to defend our patents against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management’s attention from managing our business. Moreover, we may\\xa0not have sufficient resources to defend our patents against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights.\\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent and other intellectual property litigation and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management’s time and efforts, require us to pay damages, and/or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products.\\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. Determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain. Our competitors may\\xa0assert that our products, the components of those products, the methods of using those products, or the methods we employ in manufacturing or processing those products are covered by patents held by them. In addition, they may\\xa0claim that their patents have priority over ours because their patents were filed first. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may\\xa0be applications now pending of which we are unaware, which may\\xa0later result in issued patents that our products may\\xa0infringe. There could also be existing patents that one or more components of our products may\\xa0be inadvertently infringing, of which we are unaware. As the number of participants in the market for spine disorder devices and treatments increases, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us also increases.\\nAny such claim against us, even those without merit, may\\xa0cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be required to pay substantial damages, including treble, or triple, damages if an infringement is found to be willful, and/or royalties and we could be prevented from selling our products unless we could obtain a license or were able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may\\xa0not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe those patents, and any such redesign, if possible, may be costly. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may\\xa0have to withdraw existing products from the market or may\\xa0be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, either of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights.\\n29\\nIn addition, in order to further our product development efforts, from time to time we enter into agreements with surgeons to develop new products. As consideration for product development activities rendered pursuant to these agreements, in certain\\ninstances we have agreed to pay such surgeons royalties on products developed by cooperative involvement between us and such surgeons. There can be no assurance that surgeons with whom we have entered into such an arrangement will not claim to be entitled\\nto a royalty even if we do not believe that such products were developed by cooperative involvement between us and such surgeons. Any such claim against us, even those without merit, may\\xa0cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant st\\nrain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation.\\nWe are currently involved in a patent litigation action involving NuVasive, Inc. and, if we do not prevail in this action, we could be liable for past damages and might be prevented from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or exporting certain of our products.\\nOn February 15, 2018, NuVasive, Inc. (Nuvasive) filed suit against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging that certain of our products infringe, or contribute to the infringement of, U.S.\\xa0patents owned by NuVasive. NuVasive is a large, publicly-traded corporation with significantly greater financial resources than us.\\nIntellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. We may also be subject to negative publicity due to the litigation. Pending or future patent litigation against us or any strategic partners or licensees may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party’s intellectual property, unless that party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property, and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, and if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us. Even if any strategic partners, licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party’s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Furthermore, if we are found to infringe patent claims of a third party, we may, among other things, be required to pay damages, including up to treble damages and attorney’s fees and costs, which may be substantial.\\nAn unfavorable outcome for us in this patent litigation could significantly harm our business if such outcome makes us unable to commercialize some of our current or potential products or cease some of our business operations. In addition, costs of defense and any damages resulting from the litigation may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. The litigation may also harm our relationships with existing customers and subject us to negative publicity, each of which could harm our business and financial results.\\nIf we become subject to product liability claims, we may\\xa0be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, design, manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery procedures. Spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis and even death. To date, our products have not been the subject of any material product liability claims. Currently, we carry product liability insurance in the amount of $20\\xa0million per occurrence and $20 million in the aggregate. Our existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy liabilities we might incur. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or our inability to secure coverage in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award, we may\\xa0have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves, which could harm our financial condition. If longer-term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component of our products cause tissue damage, motor impairment or other adverse effects, we could be subject to significant liability. Even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees and result in the diversion of management’s attention from managing our business. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage limits, our business could suffer and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely impacted.\\nBecause biologics products entail a potential risk of communicable disease to human recipients, we may\\xa0be the subject of product liability claims regarding our biologics products.\\nOur biologics products may\\xa0expose us to additional potential product liability claims. The development of biologics products entails a risk of additional product liability claims because of the risk of transmitting disease to human recipients, and substantial product liability claims may\\xa0be asserted against us. In addition, successful product liability claims made against one of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us or expose us to a perception that we are vulnerable to similar claims. Even a meritless or\\n30\\nunsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry, lead to significant legal fees and result in the diversion of management’s attentio\\nn from managing our business.\\nAny claims relating to our improper handling, storage or disposal of biological, hazardous and radioactive materials could be time consuming and costly.\\nThe manufacture of certain of our products, including our biologics products, involves the controlled use of biological, hazardous and/or radioactive materials and waste. Our business and facilities and those of our suppliers are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines. This liability could exceed our resources and any applicable insurance. In addition, under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, even if such contamination was not caused by us. We may\\xa0incur significant expenses in the future relating to any failure to comply with environmental laws. Any such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe may\\xa0be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees or our independent distributors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Many of our independent distributors sell, or in the past have sold, products of our competitors. We may\\xa0be subject to claims that we, our employees or our independent distributors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the trade secrets or other proprietary information of our competitors. In addition, we have been and may\\xa0in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee or independent distributor to break the terms of his or her non-competition agreement or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may\\xa0be necessary to defend against such claims. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may\\xa0lose valuable intellectual property rights and/or personnel. A loss of key personnel and/or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition of SafeOp Surgical, Inc.\\nUncertainty about our acquisition of SafeOp may adversely affect relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees, whether or not the transaction is completed.\\nIn response to the announcement of our acquisition of SafeOp, Alphatec’s and/or SafeOp’s existing or prospective customers or suppliers may:\\n•\\ndelay, defer or cease purchasing products or services from us or the combined company, or providing products or services to us or the combined company;\\n•\\ndelay or defer other decisions concerning us or the combined company; or\\n•\\notherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us or the combined company.\\nAny such delays or changes to terms could materially harm our business or the combined business.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, as a result of the acquisition of SafeOp, the employees acquired from SafeOp could experience uncertainty about their future with us.\\xa0\\xa0As a result, key employees may depart because of issues relating to such uncertainties, or a desire not to remain with us following the acquisition of SafeOp.\\xa0\\xa0Losses of customers, employees or other important strategic relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\\nWe may incur substantial expenses related to the integration of SafeOp.\\nWe may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the business, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of SafeOp.\\xa0\\xa0There are a large number of systems and functions that must be integrated, including, but not limited to, management information, accounting and finance, billing, payroll and benefits and regulatory compliance.\\xa0\\xa0Mergers are particularly challenging because their prior practices may not meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and/or generally accepted public accounting standards.\\xa0\\xa0While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration\\n31\\nexpenses.\\xa0\\xa0Mo\\nreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time.\\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate our business with the business of SafeOp and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\\nThe acquisition of SafeOp involves the combination of the businesses of two companies that currently operate as independent companies.\\xa0\\xa0Our management has limited integration experience and will be required to devote significant attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with those of SafeOp.\\xa0\\xa0Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n•\\ninability to successfully combine our business with the business of SafeOp in a manner that permits us to achieve the full synergies anticipated from the Merger;\\n•\\ncomplexities associated with managing our business and the business of SafeOp following the acquisition, including the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\\n•\\nintegrating the workforces of the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality customer service; and\\n•\\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisition, including costs to integrate the two companies that may exceed anticipated costs.\\nAny of the potential difficulties listed above could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, lenders and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of SafeOp or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results following completion of the acquisition.\\nOur actual financial and operating results after our acquisition of SafeOp could differ materially from any expectations or guidance provided by us concerning future results, including (without limitation) expectations or guidance with respect to the financial impact of any cost savings and other potential synergies.\\nWe currently expect to realize an increase in sales and other synergies as a result of the acquisition.\\xa0\\xa0These expectations are subject to numerous assumptions, however, including assumptions derived from our diligence efforts concerning the status of and prospects for SafeOp’s business, which we do not currently control, and assumptions relating to the near-term prospects for our industry generally and the markets for SafeOp’s products in particular.\\xa0\\xa0Additional assumptions that we have made include, without limitation, the following:\\n•\\nprojections of SafeOp’s future revenues;\\n•\\nanticipated financial performance of SafeOp’s products and products currently in development;\\n•\\nanticipated cost savings and other synergies associated with the Merger, including potential revenue synergies;\\n•\\nour expected capital structure after the Merger;\\n•\\namount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from the acquisition;\\n•\\ncertain other purchase accounting adjustments that we expect to record in our financial statements in connection with the acquisition;\\n•\\ntransaction costs, including those payable to our financial, legal and accounting advisors;\\n•\\nour ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with SafeOp’s customers; and\\n•\\nother financial and strategic risks of the acquisition.\\nWe cannot provide any assurances with respect to the accuracy of our assumptions, including our assumptions with respect to future revenues or revenue growth rates, if any, of SafeOp, and we cannot provide assurances with respect to our ability to realize any cost savings that we currently anticipate.\\xa0\\xa0Risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from currently anticipated results include, but are not limited to, risks relating to our ability to integrate SafeOp successfully; currently unanticipated incremental costs that we may incur in connection with integrating the two companies; risks relating to our ability to realize incremental revenues from our acquisition of SafeOp in the amounts that we currently anticipate; risks relating to the willingness of SafeOp’s customers and other partners to continue to conduct business with us following the acquisition; and numerous risks and uncertainties that affect our industry generally and the markets for our products and those of SafeOp, specifically.\\xa0\\xa0Any failure to integrate SafeOp successfully and to realize the financial benefits we currently anticipate from the acquisitionwould have a material\\n32\\nadverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition and could materially and adversely affect the trading price or trading volume\\nof our common stock.\\nThe combined businesses may not perform as we expect, or as the market expects, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\\nRisks associated with the combined company following our acquisition of SafeOpinclude:\\n•\\nintegrating businesses is a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process, and the failure to integrate successfully our business with the businesses of SafeOp in the expected time frame would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;\\n•\\nthe acquisition will significantly increase the size of our operations, and if we are not able to effectively manage our expanded operations, our stock price may be adversely affected;\\n•\\nit is possible that key employees of SafeOp might decide not to remain with us after the acquisition, and the loss of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects of Alphatec;\\n•\\nthe current sales rates of SafeOp as combined with Alphatec may dilute the observed growth rates of Alphatec;\\n•\\nthe success of Alphatec following the Closing will also depend upon relationships with third parties and pre-existing customers of us and SafeOp, which relationships may be affected by customer preferences or public attitudes about the acquisition. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; and\\n•\\nthe price of our common stock after the acquisitionmay be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the price of our common stock.\\nIf any of these events were to occur, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\\nIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable NASDAQ Global Select Market requirements and our common stock is delisted, the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock, impair the value of your investment and harm our business.\\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements.\\xa0\\xa0Although we are currently in compliance with applicable NASDAQ Global Select Market requirements,\\xa0\\xa0if we fail to continue to meet all such requirements in the future and NASDAQ determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could substantially decrease trading in our common stock and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock; adversely affect our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, if at all, to continue our operations; and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. Additionally, the market price of our common stock may decline further and stockholders may lose some or all of their investment.\\nWe expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially and the market price of our common stock may decline in value in the future.\\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may\\xa0fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and the following:\\n•\\nvolume and timing of orders for our products;\\n•\\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations;\\n•\\nour announcement or our competitors’ announcements regarding new products, product enhancements, significant contracts, number of distributors, number of hospitals and surgeons using products, acquisitions, and collaborative or strategic investments;\\n•\\nannouncements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology;\\n•\\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\\n•\\nour ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\\n33\\n•\\nchanges in healthcare policy in the U.S.;\\n•\\nproduct liability claims or other litigation involving us;\\n•\\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\\n•\\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals, clearances or applications;\\n•\\ndisputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights;\\n•\\nchanges in the availability of third-party reimbursement in the U.S.;\\n•\\nchanges in accounting principles; and\\n•\\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\\nWe may\\xa0become involved in securities class\\xa0action litigation that could divert management’s attention and harm our business.\\nThe stock market in general, The NASDAQ Global Select Market and the market for medical device companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Further, the market prices of securities of medical device companies have been particularly volatile. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class\\xa0action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may\\xa0become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition, results of operations and business.\\nSecurities analysts may\\xa0not continue to provide coverage of our common stock or may\\xa0issue negative reports, which may\\xa0have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\\nSecurities analysts may\\xa0not continue to provide research coverage of our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may\\xa0cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The trading market for our common stock may\\xa0be affected in part\\xa0by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, it may\\xa0be difficult for companies such as ours, with smaller market capitalizations, to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock. This could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock.\\nBecause of their significant stock ownership, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders will be able to exert control over us and our significant corporate decisions.\\nBased on shares outstanding at March\\xa02, 2018, our executive officers, directors and stockholders holding more than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 36% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these persons will have the ability to impact significantly the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\\nThis concentration of ownership may\\xa0harm the market price of our common stock by, among other things:\\n•\\ndelaying, deferring or preventing our change in control;\\n•\\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us;\\n•\\ncausing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all of our stockholders; or\\n•\\nreducing our public float held by non-affiliates.\\nCertain members of our Board of Directors also serve as officers and directors of HealthpointCapital, its affiliates and other portfolio companies.\\nTwo members of our Board of Directors also serve as officers and directors of our largest stockholder, HealthpointCapital, or its related entities and of other companies in which HealthpointCapital invests, including companies with which we compete or may\\xa0in the future compete. As of March\\xa02, 2018, HealthpointCapital owned approximately 13% of our outstanding common stock. Our Lead Director, Mortimer Berkowitz III, is a managing member of HGP, LLC and HGP II, LLC, the general partners of HealthpointCapital\\n34\\nPartners, LP and HealthpointCapital Partners II, LP, respectively. Director\\nR.\\xa0Ian Molson also serves on the board of managers of HealthpointCapital,\\xa0LLC.\\xa0\\xa0Each of Messrs. Berkowitz and Molson also have financial interests in HealthpointCapital investment funds.\\nBecause of these possible conflicts of interest, such directors may\\xa0direct potential business and investment opportunities to other entities rather than to us or such directors may\\xa0undertake or otherwise engage in activities or conduct on behalf of such other entities that is not in, or which may\\xa0be adverse to, our best interests. Whether a director directs an opportunity to us or to another company, our directors may\\xa0face claims of breaches of fiduciary duty and other duties relating to such opportunities. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by law, which may\\xa0require us to indemnify them against claims of breaches of such duties arising from their service on our Board of Directors. HealthpointCapital or its affiliates may\\xa0pursue acquisition opportunities that may\\xa0be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may\\xa0not be available to us. Furthermore, HealthpointCapital may\\xa0have an interest in us pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to us and our stockholders generally. In addition, if we were to seek a business combination with a target business with which one or more of our existing stockholders or directors may\\xa0be affiliated, conflicts of interest could arise in connection with negotiating the terms of and completing the business combination. Conflicts that may\\xa0arise may\\xa0not be resolved in our favor.\\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and change of control provisions in some of our employment agreements and agreements with distributors, and in some of our outstanding debt agreements, as well as the terms of our redeemable preferred stock, may\\xa0discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely.\\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may\\xa0consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may\\xa0not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions:\\n•\\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our Board of Directors;\\n•\\nallow vacancies on our Board of Directors to be filled only by resolution of our Board of Directors;\\n•\\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, blank check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a “poison pill” to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our Board of Directors;\\n•\\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\\n•\\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors and for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\\n•\\nlimit who may\\xa0call stockholder meetings.\\nSome of our employment agreements and all of our restricted stock agreements, incentive stock option agreements, performance-based stock units and restricted common stock provide for accelerated vesting of benefits, including full vesting of restricted stock and options, upon a change of control. A limited number of our agreements with our distributors include a provision that extends the term of the distribution agreement upon a change in control and makes it more difficult for us or our successor to terminate the agreement. These provisions may\\xa0discourage or prevent a change of control.\\nIn addition, in the event of a change of control, we would be required to redeem all outstanding shares of our redeemable preferred stock for an aggregate of $29.9\\xa0million, at the price of $9.00\\xa0per share. Further, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to issue additional shares of preferred stock. The terms of our redeemable preferred stock or any new preferred stock we may\\xa0issue could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control.\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a cumulative change in its equity ownership by “5-percent shareholders” of greater than 50 percentage points (by value) over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and certain other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change taxable income and taxes,\\n35\\nas applicable, may be limited. We have completed multiple rounds of financing and entered into transactions which may h\\nave resulted in an ownership change or could result in an ownership change in the future. We have not completed an analysis of our equity shifts which occurred during 2017 (and the period prior to the issuance of our 2017 annual report) pursuant to Section\\n382.\\xa0\\xa0Therefore, it is possible that we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382.We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, our ability to use our NOLs a\\nnd research and development credit carryforwards to offset our U.S. federal taxable income and taxes, as applicable, may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, sim\\nilar rules may apply and there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, new tax legislation or additional tax liabilities.\\nThe U.S. government has recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate. The overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law.\\nOur tax returns and other tax matters also are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. We cannot guarantee the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\nThis Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K and, in particular, the description of our \"Business\" set forth in Item\\xa01, the \"Risk Factors\" set forth in this Item\\xa01A and our \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" set forth in Item\\xa07 contain or incorporate a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section\\xa027A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section\\xa021E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, including statements regarding:\\n•\\nour estimates regarding anticipated operating losses, future revenue, expenses, capital requirements, uses and sources of cash and liquidity, including our anticipated revenue growth and cost savings;\\n•\\nour ability to meet the financial covenants under our credit facilities;\\n•\\nour ability to ensure that we have effective disclosure controls and procedures;\\n•\\nour not realizing the full economic benefit from the Globus Transaction, including as a result of indemnification claims under the definitive agreement and the retention by us of certain liabilities associated with the international business, and our ability to meet our obligations under the Globus supply agreement;\\n•\\nour ability to meet and potential liability from not meeting the payment obligations under the Orthotec settlement agreement;\\n•\\nour ability to regain and maintain compliance with the quality requirements of the FDA;\\n•\\nour ability to market, improve, grow, commercialize and achieve market acceptance of any of our products or any product candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future;\\n•\\nour beliefs about the features, strengths and benefits of our products;\\n•\\nour ability to continue to enhance our product offerings, outsource our manufacturing operations and expand the commercialization of our products, and the effect of our strategy;\\n•\\nour expectations about the timing, costs and benefits of the restructuring and outsourcing of our manufacturing operations;\\n•\\nour beliefs about the ability of our supplier relationships and quality processes to fulfill our production requirements;\\n•\\nour ability to successfully integrate, and realize benefits from licenses and acquisitions;\\n36\\n•\\nthe effect of any existing or future federal, state or international regulations on our ability to effectively conduct our business;\\n•\\nour estimates of market sizes and anticipated uses of our products;\\n•\\nour business strategy and our underlying assumptions about market data, demographic trends, reimbursement trends and pricing trends;\\n•\\nour ability to achieve profitability, and the potential need to raise additional funding;\\n•\\nour ability to maintain an adequate sales network for our products, including to attract and retain independent distributors;\\n•\\nour ability to enhance our U.S. distribution network;\\n•\\nour ability to increase the use and promotion of our products by training and educating surgeons and our sales network;\\n•\\nour ability to attract and retain a qualified management team, as well as other qualified personnel and advisors;\\n•\\nour ability to enter into licensing and business combination agreements with third parties and to successfully integrate the acquired technology and/or businesses;\\n•\\nour management team’s ability to accommodate growth and manage a larger organization;\\n•\\nour ability to protect our intellectual property, and to not infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties;\\n•\\nthe effects of the escalating cost of medical products and services and the effects of market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures on the healthcare industry and our business;\\n•\\nour ability to meet or exceed the industry standard in clinical and legal compliance and corporate governance programs;\\n•\\nour beliefs about our competitors and the principal competitive factors in our market and the effect of non-operative treatments on demand for our products;\\n•\\npotential liability resulting from litigation;\\n•\\nour beliefs about our employee relations;\\n•\\npotential liability resulting from a governmental review of our business practices;\\n•\\nour beliefs about the usefulness of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\\n•\\nour beliefs with respect to our critical accounting policies and the reasonableness of our estimates and assumptions;

Actual future results may vary materially from expected results.\\nWe also provide a cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties under “Risk Factors” in Item\\xa01A of this Annual Report. These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results.

Furthermore, we participated in our first depopulation from FL Citizens on December 19, 2017,\\nand the inaugural take-out of policies from TWIA on December 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2017 we have assumed 3,444 and 745 policies\\nfor the coverages of wind and hail only from FL Citizens and TWIA, respectively. In the future, we may not be able to obtain the\\nquantity or quality of policies currently obtained due to changes in the take-out programs, our inability to meet take-out program\\nparticipation requirements, or due to changes to the market in general. Additionally, competitors could change their risk profile\\ncharacteristics, and write these risks directly, which would cause us to lose these policies. The loss of these policies could\\nimpact our ability to absorb fixed expenses with lower volumes in the future.\\n8\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nA\\nsubstantial portion of our in-force policies have been assumed from state-run insurers and cover losses arising only from wind\\nand hail, which creates a large concentration of our business in wind and hail only coverage and limits our ability to implement\\nour restrictive underwriting guidelines.\\nWhile\\nboth LA Citizens and FL Citizens write full peril protection policies in addition to wind and hail only policies, the majority\\nof policies that we have obtained through these insurers’ take-out programs cover losses arising only from wind and hail.\\nFurthermore, the policies which we have assumed from TWIA are wind and hail only policies, as TWIA does not write full peril protection\\npolicies. Prior to our take-out, some of these LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA policyholders may not have been able to obtain\\nsuch coverage from any other marketplace. Approximately 26% of our total direct and assumed policies as of December 31, 2017 represent\\nLA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA wind and hail only policies. These exposures may subject us to greater risk from catastrophic\\nevents. While our voluntary independent agency program includes various restrictive underwriting strategies, we are unable to\\nimplement these strategies to the wind and hail only policies that are taken-out from LA and FL Citizens and TWIA. Pursuant to\\nthese depopulation programs, we must offer a minimum number of renewals on any policy taken out under the program, thus limiting\\nour ability to implement some of our underwriting guidelines. Upon renewal of these policies, however, we analyze replacement\\ncost scenarios to ensure the appropriate amount of coverage is in effect. Our results may be negatively impacted by these limitations.\\nWe\\nhave a risk posed by the lack of geographic diversification and concentration of policyholders in Louisiana, Florida and Texas.\\nAs\\nof December 31, 2017, we had covered risks on approximately 51,000 direct and assumed policies. Of these policies, 34,500, or\\napproximately 68% are in Louisiana, 12,800, or approximately 25%, are in Texas, while the remaining 3,400 policies, or 7% of policies,\\nare in Florida. These three states have significant exposed coastline. According to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority\\nof Louisiana, over 2 million residents — approximately 47% of the state’s population based on 2009 U.S. Census estimates\\n— live in Louisiana’s coastal parishes.\\nMaison\\ninsures personal property located in 63 of the 64 parishes in Louisiana. As of December 31, 2017, these policies are concentrated\\nwithin these parishes, presented as a percentage of our total direct and assumed policies in all states, as follows: Saint Tammany\\nParish, 9.8%, Jefferson Parish, 9.2%, and East Baton Rouge Parish, 5.8%. No other parish in Louisiana or county in Texas or Florida\\nindividually has over 5.0% of our total direct and assumed policies as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Maison has\\nwritten or assumed policies in 156 of the 254 counties that comprise the State of Texas, and in 28 of the 67 counties in Florida.\\nIf\\nwe are not able to significantly expand to other states, we may risk higher reinsurance costs and greater loss experience with\\nstorm activity occurring in Texas, Florida and Louisiana.\\nOur\\nstrategy to expand into other states, including Florida, may not succeed.\\nOur\\nstrategy for growth includes potentially entering into new states. This strategy could divert management’s attention. We\\ncannot predict whether we will be able to enter new states or whether applicable state regulators will grant Maison a license\\nto do business in such states. We cannot know if we will realize the anticipated benefits of operating in new states or if there\\nwill be substantial unanticipated costs associated with such expansion. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial\\nposition and results of operations. Although we have received authorization from the FOIR via a consent order to write personal\\nlines business in Florida, the order stipulates that we maintain catastrophe reinsurance at such levels as deemed appropriate\\nby the FOIR. Should we not be able to comply with these regulations our expansion into Florida may not succeed.\\nWe\\nhave exposure to unpredictable catastrophes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results if they occur.\\nWe\\noffer full peril protection and wind/hail-only insurance policies that cover homeowners and owners of manufactured homes, as well\\nas dwelling fire policies for owners of property rented to others, for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes.\\nWe are therefore subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of\\noperations, and/or financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes,\\nwindstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, flood, fire, and by man-made events, such as terrorist attacks. The incidence\\nand severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total\\namount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Our policyholders are currently concentrated\\nin Louisiana, Florida and Texas. These states are subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms.\\nFor example, in late August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Louisiana and Texas, impacting many of our policyholders.\\nThis event primarily impacted our Texas policyholders along with a relatively smaller number of Louisiana policyholders. We expect\\nour total gross incurred losses for Hurricane Harvey to be approximately $27,000,000, and expect to recover $22,000,000 from our\\nreinsurers from this event. Insurance companies are not permitted to reserve for catastrophes until such an event takes place.\\nTherefore, a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes, could exceed our reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse\\nimpact on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\\n9\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nOur\\nresults may fluctuate based on many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\\nThe\\ninsurance business has historically been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive\\nunderwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted an increase in pricing and, thus, more favorable\\nunderwriting profits. An increase in premium levels is often offset over time by an increasing supply of insurance capacity in\\nthe form of capital provided by new entrants and existing insurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could\\nlead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance\\nrisks and any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition to\\nthese considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles\\nof the insurance business significantly. These factors may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile.\\nWe\\ncannot predict whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our\\nability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we are not able to write insurance\\nat appropriate rates, our ability to transact business would be materially and adversely affected.\\nIncreased\\ncompetition could adversely impact our results and growth.\\nThe\\nproperty and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive. We compete not only with other stock companies but also with mutual\\ncompanies, underwriting organizations and alternative risk sharing mechanisms. Many of our competitors have substantially greater\\nresources and name recognition than us. While our principal competitors cannot be easily classified, Maison considers its primary\\ncompeting insurers to be: ASI Lloyds, American Integrity Insurance Company, Lighthouse Property Insurance Corporation, United\\nProperty & Casualty, First Community Insurance Company, Southern Fidelity Insurance, Safepoint Insurance Company, Imperial\\nF&C Insurance Company, Americas Insurance Company, Access Home Insurance Company, Family Security Insurance Company, Gulfstream\\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Company, Federated National Insurance Company, and Centauri Specialty Insurance Company. As we\\nwrite both full-peril as well as wind/hail only personal lines insurance throughout the states of Texas, Florida, and Louisiana,\\nour principal lines of business are written by numerous other insurance companies. Competition for any one account may come from\\nvery large national firms, smaller regional companies or companies that write insurance only in Florida, Louisiana and/or Texas.\\nWe compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of financial strength, availability of coverage\\ndesired by customers, underwriting criteria and quality of service to our agents and insureds. We may have difficulty in continuing\\nto compete successfully on any of these bases in the future.\\nIn\\naddition, industry developments could further increase competition in our industry, including:\\n●\\nan\\n    influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their businesses and new companies attempt\\n    to enter the insurance business as a result of better pricing and/or terms;\\n●\\nthe\\n    creation or expansion of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas\\n    or other alternative market types of coverage;\\n●\\nchanging\\n    practices caused by the Internet, which has led to greater competition in the insurance business;\\n●\\nchanges\\n    to the regulatory climate in the states in which we operate; and\\n●\\nthe\\n    passage of federal proposals for an optional federal charter that would allow some competing insurers to operate under regulations\\n    different or less stringent than those applicable to our insurance subsidiary.\\nThese\\ndevelopments and others could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive. If competition limits our\\nability to write new business at adequate rates, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.\\n10\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nIf\\nour actual losses from insureds exceed our loss reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.\\nWe\\nrecord liabilities, which are referred to as reserves, for specific claims incurred and reported as well as reserves for claims\\nincurred but not reported. The estimates of losses for reported claims are established on a case-by-case basis. Such estimates\\nare based on our particular experience with the type of risk involved and our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each\\nindividual claim. Reserves for reported claims encapsulate our total estimate of the cost to settle the claims, including investigation\\nand defense of the claim, and may be adjusted for differences between costs as originally estimated and the costs as re-estimated\\nor incurred. Reserves for incurred but not reported claims are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims, including\\nthe effects of inflation and other social and economic factors, using past experience adjusted for current trends and any other\\nfactors that would modify past experience. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claim costs,\\nfrequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Although management believes that amounts included\\nin the consolidated financial statements for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are adequate, future changes in loss development,\\nfavorable or unfavorable, may occur. Due to these uncertainties, the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves\\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nAs\\nof December 31, 2017, our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $4.5 million were comprised of incurred but not reported\\nreserves of $2.4 million and known case reserves of $2.1 million.\\nThe\\neffects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\\nAs\\nindustry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related\\nto claims and coverage may emerge. These changes may have a material adverse effect on our business by extending coverage beyond\\nour underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent\\nuntil sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability\\nunder our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued and/or renewed, and this may have a material\\nadverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\\nThe\\nlack of availability of third party adjusters during periods of high claim frequency, or the failure of third party adjusters\\nto properly evaluate claims or the failure of our claims handling administrator to pay claims fairly could adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial results and capital requirements.\\nWe\\nhave outsourced a portion of our claim adjusting function to third party adjusters and therefore rely on these third party adjusters\\nto accurately evaluate claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including\\nthe training and experience of their claims representatives, the culture of their respective claims organizations, the effectiveness\\nof their management and their ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support their claims\\nfunctions. In periods following catastrophic events, or during other periods of high claims frequency, the availability of third\\nparty adjusters may be limited. This lack of availability may result in an inability to pay our claims in a timely manner and\\ndamage our reputation in the marketplace.\\nFurthermore,\\nMMI functions as our claims administrator and authorizes payment based on recommendations from third party adjusters; any failure\\non the part of the third party adjusters to recommend payment on claims fairly could lead to material litigation, or other extra-contractual\\nliabilities, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and adversely affect our financial results.\\nIf\\nwe are unable to expand our business because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results\\nmay suffer.\\nOur\\nfuture growth may depend on our ability to expand the number of insurance policies we write, the kinds of insurance products we\\noffer and the geographic markets in which we do business, all balanced by the business risks we choose to assume and cede. Our\\nexisting sources of funds include possible sales of our securities and our earnings from operations and investments. Unexpected\\ncatastrophic events in our market areas, such as the hurricanes and other storms experienced in Florida, Louisiana and Texas in\\nrecent years, may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to limit or halt our growth strategy\\nin these and other coastal states we may enter while we deploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims, unless we are able\\nto raise additional capital.\\n11\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nOur\\nfinancial results may be negatively affected by the fact that a portion of our income is generated by the investment of our company’s\\ncapital and surplus, premiums and loss reserves in various investment vehicles.\\nA\\nportion of our expected income is likely to be generated by the investment of our cash reserves in money market funds, bonds,\\nand other investment vehicles. The amount of income generated from these investments is a function of our investment policy, available\\ninvestment opportunities, and the amount of invested assets. If we experience larger than expected losses, our invested assets\\nmay need to be liquidated in order to provide the cash needed to pay current claims, which may result in lower investment income.\\nWe periodically review our investment policy in light of our then-current circumstances, including liquidity needs, and available\\ninvestment opportunities. Fluctuating interest rates and other economic factors make it difficult to accurately estimate the amount\\nof investment income that will actually be realized. We may realize losses on our investments, which may have a material adverse\\nimpact on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\\nWe\\nmay experience financial exposure from climate change.\\nOur\\nfinancial exposure from climate change is most notably associated with losses in connection with increasing occurrences of weather-related\\nevents striking the states in which we insure risks. Our maximum reinsurance coverage amount is determined by subjecting our homeowner\\nexposures to statistical forecasting models that are designed to quantify a catastrophic event in terms of the frequency of a\\nstorm occurring once in every 100 years. 100 years is used as a measure of the relative size of a storm as compared to a storm\\nexpected to occur once every 250 years, which would be larger, or conversely, a storm expected to occur once every 50 years, which\\nwould be smaller. We assess the appropriateness of the level of reinsurance we purchase by giving consideration to our own risk\\nappetite, the opinions of independent rating agencies as well as the requirements of state regulators. Our amount of losses we\\nretain (referred to as our deductible) in connection with a catastrophic event is determined by market capacity, pricing conditions\\nand surplus preservation.\\nIndustry\\ntrends, such as increased litigation against the insurance industry and individual insurers, the willingness of courts to expand\\ncovered causes of loss, rising jury awards, and the escalation of loss severity, may contribute to increased costs and to the\\ndeterioration of the reserves of our insurance subsidiary.\\nThe\\npropensity of policyholders and third party claimants to litigate, the willingness of courts to expand causes of loss and the\\nsize of awards may render the loss reserves of our insurance subsidiary inadequate for current and future losses, which could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows.\\nOur\\nability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry and our ability to expand our business may be negatively affected\\nby the fact that we do not have a rating from A.M. Best.\\nWe\\nare not rated by A.M. Best, although we currently have a Financial Stability Rating (FSR) of ‘A’ Exceptional from\\nDemotech, Inc. We have never been reviewed by A.M. Best and do not intend to seek a rating from A.M. Best. Unlike Demotech, A.M.\\nBest may penalize companies that are highly leveraged, i.e. that utilize reinsurance to support premium writings. We do not plan\\nto give up revenues or efficiency of size as a means to qualify for an acceptable A.M. Best rating. While our Demotech rating\\nhas proved satisfactory to date in attracting an acceptable amount of business from independent agents, some independent agents\\nare reluctant to do business with a company that is not rated by A.M. Best. As a result, not having an A.M. Best rating may prevent\\nus from expanding our business into certain independent agencies or limit our access to credit from certain financial institutions,\\nwhich may in turn limit our ability to compete with large, national insurance companies and certain regional insurance companies.\\nAn\\nadverse rating from Demotech may negatively impact our ability to write new policies, renew desirable policies, or obtain adequate\\nreinsurance, which could harm our business.\\nAlthough\\nour insurance subsidiary company currently has a Financial Stability Rating of ‘A’ Exceptional from Demotech, Inc.,\\nthe withdrawal of our rating could limit or prevent us from writing or renewing desirable insurance policies, from competing with\\ninsurers who have higher ratings, or from obtaining adequate reinsurance. The withdrawal or downgrade of our rating could have\\na material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position because our insurance policies may no longer be\\nacceptable to the secondary marketplace or mortgage lenders. Furthermore, a withdrawal or downgrade of our rating could prevent\\nindependent agencies from selling and servicing our insurance policies.\\n12\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nWe\\nrely on independent agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents, our\\nrevenues would be negatively affected.\\nWhile\\nwe currently obtain some of our policies through the assumption of policies from TWIA and LA and FL Citizens, we still require\\nthe cooperation and consent of our network of independent agents. We rely on these independent agents to be the primary source\\nfor our property insurance policies. Many of our competitors also rely on independent agents. As a result, we must compete with\\nother insurers for independent agents’ business. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower\\npremiums for insurance coverage or higher commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions are not competitive,\\nwe may find it difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products, or may receive less attractive business\\nthan our competitors. A material reduction in the amount of our products that independent agents sell would adversely affect our\\nrevenues.\\nWe\\nface a risk of non-availability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to write business and\\nour results of operations and financial condition.\\nWe\\nuse, and we expect to continue to use, reinsurance to help manage our exposure to catastrophic losses due to various events, including\\nhurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, fire and man-made events. The availability and cost of reinsurance\\nare each subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control which can affect business volume and profitability. We may\\nbe unable to maintain our current reinsurance coverage, to obtain additional reinsurance coverage in the event our current reinsurance\\ncoverage is exhausted by a catastrophic event, or to obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts or at acceptable rates.\\nSimilar risks exist whether we are seeking to replace coverage terminated during the applicable coverage period or to renew or\\nreplace coverage upon its expiration. Each of the FOIR, LDI and TDI require that we maintain a minimum level of reinsurance coverage\\nas a condition of writing insurance in their jurisdictions. Should we not be able to maintain this coverage, these regulators\\nmay revoke our license to write insurance. We can provide no assurance that we can obtain sufficient reinsurance to cover losses\\nresulting from one or more storms in the future, or that we can obtain such reinsurance in a timely or cost-effective manner.\\nIf we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or to obtain new reinsurance coverage, either our net exposure to risk would increase\\nor, if we are unwilling to accept an increase in net risk exposures, we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite.\\nEither increasing our net exposure to risk or reducing the amount of risk we underwrite may cause a material adverse effect on\\nour results of operations and our financial condition.\\nWe\\nface a risk of non-collectability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\\nand/or financial condition.\\nAlthough\\nreinsurers are liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage we purchase, we remain primarily liable as the direct insurer\\non all risks that we reinsure. Accordingly, our reinsurance agreements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. As a result,\\nwe are subject to risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers, including the risks that: (a) our reinsurers\\nmay dispute some of our reinsurance claims based on contract terms, and we may ultimately receive partial or no payment, or (b)\\nthe amount of losses that reinsurers incur related to worldwide catastrophes may materially harm the financial condition of our\\nreinsurers and cause them to default on their obligations. While we will attempt to manage these risks through underwriting guidelines,\\ncollateral requirements, financial strength ratings, credit reviews and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful.\\nFurther, while we may require collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable\\njurisdictions, balances generally are not collateralized because it has not always been standard business practice to require\\nsecurity for balances due. As a result, our exposure to credit risk may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\\nfinancial condition and cash flow.\\nWe\\nuse actuarially driven catastrophe models to provide us with risk management guidelines.\\nAs is common practice within the insurance industry, we run our exposures in an actuarially driven model that\\nuses past storm data to predict future loss of certain events reoccurring based upon the location and other data of our insured\\nproperties. These models, which are provided by independent third parties, can produce wide ranging results within the states we\\ndo business. We use these models along with the advice of our reinsurance intermediary to select the amount and type of reinsurance\\nto mitigate the loss of capital from catastrophic wind events. These models are used to develop future theoretical loss scenarios,\\nand there are risks that the amount of reinsurance purchased will be insufficient to cover the ultimate catastrophic wind event.\\nFurthermore, the probability of the occurrence of a catastrophic event may be larger than that predicted by the models.\\n13\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nThe\\nfailure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results\\nof operations.\\nWe\\nutilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure including:\\n●\\nutilizing\\n    restrictive underwriting criteria;\\n●\\ncarefully\\n    evaluating and monitoring the terms and conditions of our policies;\\n●\\nfocusing\\n    on our risk aggregations by geographic zones; and\\n●\\nceding\\n    insurance risk to reinsurance companies.\\nHowever,\\nthere are inherent limitations in all of these tactics. An event or series of events may result in loss levels which could have\\na material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nThe\\nfailure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our\\nresults of operations.\\nVarious\\nprovisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which have been drafted to limit our risks, may not\\nbe enforceable in the manner we intend. At the present time, we employ a variety of endorsements to our policies that limit exposure\\nto known risks, including but not limited to exclusions relating to flood coverage for homes in close proximity to the coast line.\\nIn addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us or to our claims handling\\nadministrator and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While our insurance product exclusions\\nand limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court\\nor regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or that legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of\\nsuch endorsements and limitations in a way that would increase our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect\\non our financial condition or results of operations.\\nMaison\\nis subject to an independent third party rating agency and must maintain certain rating levels to continue to write much of its\\ncurrent and future policies.\\nIn\\nthe event that Maison fails to maintain an “A” rating given by a rating agency acceptable to both our insurance agents\\nand our insureds’ home lenders, it will be unable to continue to write much of its current and future insurance policies.\\nIn order to maintain this rating, among several factors, Maison must maintain certain minimum capital and surplus. The loss of\\nsuch an acceptable rating may lead to a significant decline in our premium volume and adversely affect the results of our operations.\\nDemotech, Inc. affirmed our Financial Stability Rating of “A” on December 8, 2017. This “Exceptional”\\nrating continues as long as we continue to satisfy their requirements, including improving underwriting results, reporting risk-based\\ncapital and other financial measures, submitting quarterly statutory financial statements within 45 days of the period end and\\nsubmitting annual statutory financial statements within 60 days of the period end.\\nIf\\nwe fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial\\nresults accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nEnsuring\\nthat we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial\\nstatements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the\\nSarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations\\nof the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. We currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the\\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), and a smaller reporting company under the regulations of the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Both emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies are\\nexempt from the requirement to include the auditor’s report of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\nand we will continue to be exempt until such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company or smaller reporting company.\\nRegardless of our qualification status, we have implemented substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the\\nreporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable requirements of Nasdaq, among other items. Maintaining these internal\\ncontrols is costly and may divert management’s attention.\\n14\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nOur\\nevaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to\\nreport our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions\\nby the SEC, or violations of Nasdaq’s listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due\\nto a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial\\nstatements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in\\nour internal controls over financial reporting. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\\nWhile\\nwe currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, and as a smaller reporting company under SEC regulations,\\nwe cannot be certain if we take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to these companies that we will not\\nmake our common stock less attractive to investors. Once we lose emerging growth and smaller reporting company status, the costs\\nand demands placed upon our management are expected to increase.\\nThe\\nJOBS Act permits emerging growth companies and the SEC’s rules permit smaller reporting companies like us to take advantage\\nof certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth or\\nsmaller reporting companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth or smaller reporting company, we are permitted, and we\\nintend to, omit the auditor’s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required\\nby the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also take advantage of the exemption provided under the JOBS Act from the requirements to submit\\nsay on pay, say on frequency, and say on golden parachute votes to our stockholders and we will avail ourselves of reduced executive\\ncompensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also\\nprovides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards\\nprovided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company\\ncan therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\\nWe have elected to take advantage of these benefits until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively\\nand irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that\\ncomply with such new or revised accounting standards.\\nWe\\nwill continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which\\nwe had total annual gross revenues of at least $1 billion (as indexed for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2019, (iii) the date on\\nwhich we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on\\nwhich we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined under the Exchange Act. In addition, we will continue\\nto be a smaller reporting company until we have more than $75 million in public float (based on our common equity) measured as\\nof the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public float (based\\non our common equity), annual revenues of more than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited\\nfinancial statements are available.\\nUntil\\nsuch time that we lose emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company status, it is unclear if investors will find our\\ncommon stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive\\nas a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could\\ncause our stock price to decline. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon our\\nmanagement to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements.\\nWe\\nhave directors who also serve as directors and/or executive officers for our controlling stockholders, which may lead to conflicting\\ninterests.\\nAs\\na result of our having previously spun off from KFSI, we have directors who also serve as directors and executive officers of\\nKFSI, 1347 Advisors, LLC (“1347 Advisors”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of KFSI, Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:\\nAFH) (“Atlas”), and Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB) (“Limbach”). As of December 31, 2017, KFSI and\\nits affiliates beneficially owned approximately 8.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock and also warrants and performance\\nshares to acquire an additional 23.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock. We also have directors who serve as executive\\nofficers and/or directors of FGI and its affiliates, which together, as of December 31, 2017, beneficially owned approximately\\n36.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, FGI and its affiliates beneficially own 4.9% of our outstanding\\nshares of 8.00% cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A.\\n15\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nOur\\nexecutive officers and members of our Company’s Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders; likewise,\\npersons who serve in similar capacities at KFSI, 1347 Advisors, Atlas, and Limbach and FGI have fiduciary duties to those companies’\\ninvestors. We may find, though, the potential for a conflict of interest if our Company and one or more of these other companies\\npursue acquisitions, investments and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of us. Our directors who find\\nthemselves in these multiple roles may, as a result, have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with\\nrespect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Furthermore, our\\ndirectors who find themselves in these multiple roles own stock options, shares of common stock and other securities in some of\\nthese entities. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable\\nindividuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and these other entities. From time\\nto time, we may enter into transactions with or participate jointly in investments with KFSI, 1347 Advisors, Atlas, Limbach, or\\nFGI or its affiliates. We may create new situations in the future in which our directors serve as directors or executive officers\\nin future investment holdings of such entities.\\nOur\\ninformation technology systems may fail or suffer a loss of security which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\\nOur\\nbusiness is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems. We\\nrely on these systems to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for our underwriting business, as well as to\\nhandle our policy administration processes (such as the printing and mailing of our policies, endorsements, and renewal notices,\\netc.). Our operations are dependent upon our ability to process our business timely and efficiently and protect our information\\nsystems from physical loss or unauthorized access. In the event one or more of our facilities cannot be accessed due to a natural\\ncatastrophe, terrorist attack or power outage, or systems and telecommunications failures or outages, external attacks such as\\ncomputer viruses, malware or cyber-attacks, or other disruptions occur, our ability to perform business operations on a timely\\nbasis could be significantly impaired and may cause our systems to be inaccessible for an extended period of time. A sustained\\nbusiness interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to perform necessary business operations in a timely\\nmanner, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and have a material adverse effect our financial condition\\nand results of operations.\\nOur\\noperations also depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in\\nour computer systems and networks. From time to time, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and\\ncomputer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misconduct\\nand other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition,\\nwe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. Our systems and networks\\nmay be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access\\nto or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers’ information, which in turn may result in legal\\nclaims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further\\nexposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisers or other damage to our business.\\nThe\\ndevelopment and expansion of our business is dependent upon the successful development and implementation of advanced computer\\nand data processing systems. The failure of these systems to function as planned could slow our growth and adversely affect our\\nfuture business volume and results of operations.\\nWe\\nbelieve that our independent agents will play a key role in our efforts to increase the number of voluntary policies written by\\nour insurance subsidiary. We utilize various policy administration, rating, and issuance systems. Internet disruptions or system\\nfailures of our current policy administration, policy rating and policy issuance system could affect our future business volume\\nand results of operations. In addition, a security breach of our computer systems could damage our reputation or result in liability.\\nWe retain confidential information regarding our business dealings and our customers in our computer systems. We may be required\\nto spend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such\\nbreaches. It is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure. Despite the implementation of security measures,\\nour infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or\\nother disruptive problems. In addition, we could be subject to liability if hackers were able to penetrate our network security\\nor otherwise misappropriate customer’s personal data or other confidential information.\\n16\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nAny\\nfailure on the part of our third-party policy administration processor could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation\\nin the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\\nWe\\noutsource our policy administration process to an unaffiliated, independent third party service provider. Any failure on the part\\nof such third party to properly handle our policy administration process could lead to material litigation, extra-contractual\\nliabilities, regulatory action, and undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial\\nresults.\\nWe\\nhave a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our inexperience as a public company and the requirements of being\\na public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified\\nboard members and have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\\nWe\\nhave a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our Board of Directors and senior management team has overall responsibility\\nfor our management and not all of our directors and members of our senior management team have prior experience in operating a\\npublic company. As a publicly-traded company, we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and\\nprocedures in order to satisfy our periodic SEC reporting and Nasdaq obligations. Management’s past experience may not be\\nsufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate our company. Failure to\\ndo so could jeopardize our status as a public company, and the loss of such status may have a material adverse effect on us and\\nour stockholders.\\nIn\\naddition, as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank\\nAct, and Nasdaq rules, including those promulgated in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and\\nregulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and\\nincrease demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and\\ncurrent reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that\\nwe maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. To maintain and improve\\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we need to continually commit significant resources, maintain staff\\nand provide additional management oversight. In addition, sustaining our growth will require us to commit additional management,\\noperational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our organization and to maintain appropriate operational\\nand financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business\\nconcerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nAs\\na public company, we incur significant annual expenses related to these steps associated with, among other things, director fees,\\nreporting requirements, transfer agent fees, accounting, legal and administrative personnel, auditing and legal fees and similar\\nexpenses. We also incur higher costs for director and officer liability insurance. Any of these factors make it more difficult\\nfor us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors. Finally, we expect to incur additional costs once we\\nlose emerging growth company and/or smaller reporting company status.\\nWe\\nmay require additional capital in the future which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\\nOur\\nfuture capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish\\npremium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that our present capital is insufficient to meet\\nfuture operating requirements or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our projected\\ngrowth. Many factors will affect our capital needs as well as their amount and timing, including our growth and profitability,\\nthe availability of reinsurance, as well as possible acquisition opportunities, market disruptions and other developments. If\\nwe had to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that\\nare not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our stockholders could result, and in any case such securities\\nmay have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital\\non favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\\n17\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nOur\\nacquisition strategy may not succeed.\\nOur\\nstrategy for growth includes, among other things, acquisition transactions. This strategy could divert management’s attention,\\nor, if implemented, create difficulties including the integration of operations and the retention of employees, and the contingent\\nand latent risks associated with our transaction partner. The risks associated with the acquisition of a smaller insurance company\\ninclude:\\n●\\ninadequacy\\n    of reserves for losses and loss expenses and other unanticipated liabilities;\\n●\\nquality\\n    of their data and underwriting processes;\\n●\\nthe\\n    need to supplement management with additional experienced personnel;\\n●\\nconditions\\n    imposed by regulatory agencies that make the realization of cost-savings through integration of operations more difficult;\\n●\\nthe\\n    requirement for regulatory approval for certain acquisitions;\\n●\\na\\n    need for additional capital that was not anticipated at the time of the acquisition; and\\n●\\nthe\\n    use of a substantial amount of our management’s time.\\nWe\\nmay be unable to identify and complete a future transaction on terms favorable to us. We may not know if we will realize the anticipated\\nbenefits of a completed transaction and there may be substantial unanticipated costs associated with the transaction. In addition,\\na future transaction may result in tax consequences at either or both the stockholder and company level, potentially dilutive\\nissuances of our securities, the incurrence of additional debt and the recognition of potential impairment of goodwill and other\\nintangible assets. Each of these factors could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\\nThe\\ndevelopment and implementation of new technologies will require an additional investment of our capital resources in the future.\\nFrequent\\ntechnological changes, new products and services and evolving industry standards all influence the insurance business. The Internet,\\nfor example, is increasingly used to transmit benefits and related information to clients and to facilitate business-to-business\\ninformation exchange and transactions. We believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional\\ninvestment of our capital resources in the future. We have not determined, however, the amount of resources and the time that\\nthis development and implementation may require, which may result in short-term, unexpected interruptions to our business, or\\nmay result in a competitive disadvantage in price and/or efficiency, as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies.\\nOur\\nsuccess depends on our ability to accurately price the risks we underwrite.\\nThe\\nresults of our operations and the financial condition of our insurance subsidiary depend on our ability to underwrite and set\\npremium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses,\\nloss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect\\nand properly analyze a substantial amount of data, develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas, closely monitor and timely\\nrecognize changes in trends and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to undertake\\nthese efforts successfully, and thereby price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some\\nof which are outside our control, including:\\n●\\nthe\\n    availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze such data;\\n●\\nuncertainties\\n    that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions;\\n●\\nour\\n    selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques;\\n●\\nchanges\\n    in legal standards, claim settlement practices and restoration costs; and\\n●\\nlegislatively\\n    imposed consumer initiatives.\\nBecause\\nwe have assumed a substantial portion of our current policies from LA Citizens, FL Citizens and TWIA, our rates are based, to\\na certain extent, on the rates charged by those insurers. In determining the rates we charge in connection with the policies we\\nhave assumed, our rates must be equal to or less than the rates previously charged by the state-run insurer. If LA or FL Citizens\\nreduces its rates, we must reduce our rates to keep them equivalent to or less than their rates; however, if LA or FL Citizens\\nincreases its rates, we may not automatically increase our rates. Additionally, absent certain circumstances, we must continue\\nto provide coverage to the policyholders that we assume from LA or FL Citizens if we have underwritten the same policyholder for\\na period of three consecutive years. In determining the rates we charge in connection with the policies we have assumed from TWIA,\\nour rates must be no greater than 115% of premiums charged by TWIA for comparable coverage. Additionally, we must continue to\\nprovide coverage to the policyholders under those policies that we have assumed from TWIA for a minimum of three successive renewal\\nperiods. If we underprice our risks, it may negatively affect our profit margins and if we overprice risks, it could reduce our\\ncustomer retention, sales volume and competitiveness. Either event may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of\\nour insurance subsidiary.\\n18\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nCurrent\\noperating resources are necessary to develop future new insurance products.\\nWe\\ncurrently intend to expand our product offerings by underwriting additional insurance products and programs, and marketing them\\nthrough our distribution network. Expansion of our product offerings will result in increases in expenses due to additional costs\\nincurred in actuarial rate justifications, software and personnel. Offering additional insurance products will also require regulatory\\napproval, further increasing our costs and potentially affecting the speed with which we will be able to pursue new market opportunities.\\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful bringing new insurance products to our marketplace.\\nAs\\nan insurance holding company, we are currently subject to regulation by the States of Louisiana, Texas, and Florida and in the\\nfuture may become subject to regulation by certain other states or a federal regulator.\\nAll\\nstates regulate insurance holding company systems. State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company\\nin the holding company group to register with the department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information\\nconcerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management\\nor financial condition of the insurers within the group. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material\\nagreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including without limitation loans, investments, asset transfers,\\ntransactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance\\ntransactions, dividends, and consolidated tax allocation agreements. Insurance holding company regulations generally provide that\\ntransactions between an insurance company and its affiliates must be fair and equitable, allocated between the parties in accordance\\nwith customary accounting practices, and fully disclosed in the records of the respective parties. Many types of transactions\\nbetween an insurance company and its affiliates, such as transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend\\npayments from insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within the system, may be subject to\\nprior notice to, or prior approval by, state regulatory authorities. If we are unable to provide the required materials or obtain\\nthe requisite prior approval for a specific transaction, we may be precluded from taking the actions, which could adversely affect\\nour financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur\\ninsurance subsidiary currently operates in Louisiana, Florida and Texas. In the future, our insurance subsidiary may become authorized\\nto transact business in other states and therefore will become subject to the laws and regulatory requirements of those states.\\nThese regulations may vary from state to state, and certain states may have regulations which conflict with the regulations of\\nother states. Currently, the federal government’s role in regulating or dictating the policies of insurance companies is\\nlimited. However, Congress, from time to time, considers proposals that would increase the role of the federal government in insurance\\nregulation, either in addition to or in lieu of state regulation. The impact of any future federal insurance regulation on our\\ninsurance operations is unclear and may adversely impact our business or competitive position.\\nOur\\ninsurance subsidiary is subject to extensive regulation which may reduce our profitability or inhibit our growth. Moreover, if\\nwe fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may have a material\\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe\\ninsurance industry is highly regulated and supervised. Maison, our insurance company subsidiary, is subject to the supervision\\nand regulation of the state in which it is domiciled and the states in which it does business. Such supervision and regulation\\nis primarily designed to protect policyholders rather than stockholders. These regulations are generally administered by a department\\nof insurance in each state and relate to, among other things:\\n●\\nthe\\n    content and timing of required notices and other policyholder information;\\n●\\nthe\\n    amount of premiums the insurer may write in relation to its surplus;\\n●\\nthe\\n    amount and nature of reinsurance a company is required to purchase;\\n●\\napproval\\n    of insurance company acquisitions;\\n19\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\n●\\nparticipation\\n    in guaranty funds and other statutorily-created markets or organizations;\\n●\\nbusiness\\n    operations and claims practices;\\n●\\napproval\\n    of policy forms and premium rates;\\n●\\nstandards\\n    of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;\\n●\\nlicensing\\n    of insurers and their products;\\n●\\nlicensing\\n    and appointment of agents and managing general agents;\\n●\\nrestrictions\\n    on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;\\n●\\nrestrictions\\n    on the ability of our insurance company subsidiary to pay dividends to us;\\n●\\nrestrictions\\n    on transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates;\\n●\\nrestrictions\\n    on the size of risks insurable under a single policy;\\n●\\nrequiring\\n    deposits for the benefit of policyholders;\\n●\\nrequiring\\n    certain methods of accounting;\\n●\\nperiodic\\n    examinations of our operations and finances;\\n●\\nprescribing\\n    the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and\\n●\\nrequiring\\n    reserves as required by statutory accounting rules.\\nThe\\nLDI and regulators in other jurisdictions where our insurance company subsidiary operates or may operate conduct periodic examinations\\nof the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, information\\nrelating to and notices and approvals of transactions with affiliated parties, and other matters. These regulatory requirements\\nmay adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. These regulatory authorities also\\nconduct periodic examinations into insurers’ business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance\\noperations or differences between our interpretations of regulatory requirements and those of the regulators. In addition, regulatory\\nauthorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations.\\nIn some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally\\nfollowed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If\\nwe do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory\\nauthorities could prevent or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our business or otherwise penalize us. Any\\nsuch outcome may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\\nFinally,\\nchanges in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by\\nregulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\\nMaison\\nis subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory\\naction.\\nMaison\\nis subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of Texas,\\nFlorida and Louisiana (and other states where we may eventually conduct business). The risk-based capital standards, based upon\\nthe Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, require Maison to report\\nits results of risk-based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards\\nprovide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company’s total adjusted capital,\\nas calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level\\nrisk-based capital is determined by applying the NAIC’s risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of\\ncapital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations.\\nIn\\naddition, Maison is required to maintain certain minimum capital and surplus and to limit its written premiums to specified multiples\\nof its capital and surplus. Maison could exceed these ratios if its volume increases faster than anticipated or if its surplus\\ndeclines due to catastrophic and/or non-catastrophic losses, excessive underwriting and/or operational expenses.\\nAny\\nfailure by Maison to meet the applicable risk-based capital or minimum statutory capital requirements or the writings ratio limitations\\nimposed by the laws of the states in which Maison operates could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed\\nby state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. Any changes\\nin existing risk-based capital requirements, minimum statutory capital requirements or applicable writings ratios may require\\nus to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do.\\n20\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nShould\\nour retention rate be less than anticipated, our future results will be negatively impacted.\\nWe\\nmake assumptions about the rate at which our existing policies will renew for the purpose of projecting premiums written and the\\namount of reinsurance which we obtain based upon the projected amount of future exposure. If the actual exposure renewed is less\\nthan anticipated, our premiums written would be adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may purchase more reinsurance than may be\\nappropriate given the actual amount of coverage in force.\\nHolders\\nof our outstanding shares of 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are\\nsenior to the rights of the holders of our common shares.\\nAs\\nof March 26, 2018, we have issued and outstanding 700,000 shares of preferred stock designated as 8.00% Cumulative Preferred\\nStock, Series A, par value $25.00 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). The aggregate liquidation preference\\nwith respect to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is approximately $17.5 million, and annual dividends\\non the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are approximately $1.4 million. Holders of our Series A Preferred\\nStock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee\\nthereof, out of lawfully available funds for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends from and including the original\\nissue date at the rate of 8.00% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $2.00 per annum per share).\\nUpon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common\\nshares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus an amount\\nequal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of payment. This would reduce the remaining amount\\nof our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common shares.\\nOur\\nBoard of Directors has the authority to designate and issue additional preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights\\nthat are senior to those of our common shares similar to the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. Because our\\ndecision to issue additional securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict\\nor estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities\\nissuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interests.\\nWe\\ndepend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate and transfer funds to meet our financial obligations.\\nOur\\noperations are substantially conducted through our subsidiaries, Maison, MMI and ClaimCor. As an insurance holding company, we\\nare dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiary companies to serve as operating capital. The ability\\nof Maison, our insurance company subsidiary, to pay dividends to us is subject to certain restrictions imposed under Louisiana\\ninsurance law, which is the state of domicile for Maison. Dividends payments to us may also be restricted pursuant to a consent\\nagreement entered into with the LDI and the FOIR as a condition of our licensure in each state. Interest payments on the surplus\\nnotes issued to us by Maison are also subject to the prior approval of the LDI. Our other subsidiary companies collect the majority\\nof their revenue through their affiliation with Maison. Our subsidiary company, MMI, earns commission income from Maison for underwriting,\\npolicy administration, claims handling, and other services provided to Maison. Our subsidiary company, ClaimCor, earns claims\\nadjusting income for adjusting certain of the claims of Maison’s policyholders. While dividend payments from our other subsidiaries\\nare not restricted under insurance law, the underlying contracts between Maison and our other subsidiary companies are regulated\\nby, and subject to the approval of, insurance regulators.\\nAs\\na result of the regulatory and contractual restrictions described above, we may not be able to receive dividends from Maison or\\nour other subsidiaries, which would affect our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred\\nStock. Under Delaware corporate law, we are generally restricted to paying dividends from either Company surplus or from net income\\nfrom the current or preceding fiscal year so long as the payment of the dividends does not reduce the value of the Company’s\\nnet assets below the stated value of the Company’s outstanding preferred shares. Our ability to make dividend payments on\\nour capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock, is therefore dependent on dividends and other distributions or payments\\nfrom our subsidiaries. The ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us depends\\nupon the availability of cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets and other capital-raising activities.\\nWe cannot be certain of the future availability of such distributions and the lack of any such distributions may adversely affect\\nour ability to make dividend payments on our capital stock, including our Series A Preferred Stock.\\n21\\n1347\\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\\nWe\\nmay be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\\nWe\\ndepend on our ability to attract and retain experienced underwriting talent and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable\\nabout our business. If the quality of our underwriters and other personnel decreases, we may be unable to maintain our current\\ncompetitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations, which could adversely\\naffect our results. Because we have relatively few employees, the loss of, or failure to attract, key personnel could also significantly\\nimpede the financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives of our company. Our success depends to a substantial extent\\non the ability and experience of our senior management. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability\\nto attract and retain additional skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employees. We may not be\\nsuccessful in doing so, because the competition for experienced personnel in the insurance industry is intense. Many of the companies\\nwith which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. We cannot be certain of our ability to identify,\\nhire and retain adequately qualified personnel. We do not have employment agreements with our employees. Failure to identify,\\nhire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations.\\nChanges\\nin tax laws could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nThe\\nU.S. Congress recently passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law by the President on December 22, 2017. One\\nof the key features of the legislation is a reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%. Due to this reduction,\\nthe Company has incurred an initial charge to earnings to write off a portion of the net deferred tax asset position recognized\\nin the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, future operating results would be taxed at the lower rate. The Company’s\\ninsurance subsidiary has also incurred a charge associated with the write off of its deferred tax asset, which has resulted in\\na decrease in its capital and surplus under statutory accounting principles for insurance companies. If corporate Federal income\\ntax rates were reduced, federal and/or state legislation might be enacted to help offset the decrease in tax revenue to the government.\\nSuch legislation might reduce or eliminate certain tax advantages that are currently beneficial to the Company, including tax-exempt\\ninterest on municipal securities, the dividends received deduction and certain tax credits. Accordingly, the fair value of the\\nCompany’s investments might be adversely impacted. Under the new tax law, the Company’s net deferred tax asset decreased\\n$350,000 on a consolidated basis to $70,000 as of December 31, 2017 from $420,000 as of December 31, 2016 and decreased $284,000,\\non a regulatory basis, in the Company’s insurance subsidiary.', 'ITEM\\xa01A.\\nRISK FACTORS\\nAny of the following risks could harm our business, results of operations and financial\\ncondition and an investment in our stock. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\\nMarket conditions and economic cyclicality may adversely affect our industry.\\nWe are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy and market conditions generally. Local employment and local economic conditions may be effected to a greater\\nextent than historically because of the growth of automobile manufacturing and related suppliers located in our markets. These businesses are adversely affected by higher interest rates and experience cyclicality of sales.\\nWe believe the following, among other things, may affect us in 2018:\\n•\\nWe expect to face continued high levels of regulation of our industry as a result of continued Dodd-Frank Act rulemaking and other initiatives by the U.S. government and its regulatory agencies, including the CFPB.\\nCompliance with such regulations may increase our costs, reduce our profitability, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and serve customers’ needs. Various pending bills in Congress and statements by our regulators may offer\\nsome regulatory relief for banking organizations of our size, though we believe that our efforts toward comprehensive regulatory relief would be slow and contentious. We are uncertain about the scope, nature and timing of any regulatory relief and\\nits effect on us.\\n•\\nAlthough unemployment nationally is low, the economy is growing relatively slowly. The Federal Reserve, adopted in September 2014 a normalization of monetary policy, which includes gradually raising the Federal\\nReserve’s target range for the Federal Funds rate to more normal levels and gradually reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of U.S. government and agency securities. The Federal Reserve’s target Federal Funds rate has increased five\\ntimes since December 2015 in 25 basis point increments from 0.25% to 1.50% on December\\xa013, 2017. Although the Federal Reserve considers the target Federal Funds rate its primary means of monetary policy normalization, in September 2017, it also\\nbegan reducing its securities holding by not reinvesting the principal of maturing securities, subject to certain monthly caps on amounts not reinvested. Such reduction may also push interest rates higher and reduce liquidity in the financial\\nsystem. We expect the Federal Reserve to continue to increase target rates at a moderate pace, subject to pauses due to any new domestic or global events. The nature and timing of any changes in monetary policies and their effect on us and the Bank\\ncannot be predicted. The turnover of a majority of the Federal Reserve Board and the members of its Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) and the appointment of a new Federal Reserve Chairman may result in changes in policy and timing and\\namount of monetary policy normalization.\\n•\\nMarket developments, including employment and price levels, stock market volatility and declines, and tax changes, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) signed into law by the President on\\nDecember\\xa022, 2017, may affect consumer confidence levels from time to time in different directions, and may cause adverse changes in payment behaviors and payment rates, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could affect\\nour charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\\n•\\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers and those we do business with, and to estimate the values of our assets and collateral for loans may be impaired if the models and approaches we use become\\nless predictive of future behaviors and valuations. The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure or estimate the value of certain assets requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic\\nconditions and how those economic predictions might affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans or the value of assets.\\n•\\nThe 2017 Tax Act substantially limits the deductibility of all state and local taxes for U.S. taxpayers, including property taxes, lowers the cap on residential mortgage indebtedness for which U.S. taxpayers may deduct\\ninterest. These changes could have adverse effects on home sales, the volume of new mortgage and home equity loans and the values and salability of residences held as collateral for loans.\\n•\\nOur ability to borrow from and engage in other business with other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including, among\\nother things, investor expectations and changes in regulations.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nFailures of other financial institutions in our markets and increasing consolidation of financial services companies as a result of market conditions could increase our deposits and assets and necessitate additional\\ncapital, and could have unexpected adverse effects upon us and our business.\\n•\\nThe Dodd-Frank Act’s Volcker Rule, including final regulations adopted on December\\xa010, 2013, may affect us adversely by reducing market liquidity and securities inventories at those institutions where we buy\\nand sell securities for our portfolio and increasing the\\nbid-ask\\nspreads on securities we purchase or sell. These rules have decreased the range of permissible investments, such as certain interests in\\ncollateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), which we could otherwise use to diversify our assets and for asset/liability management. Pending legislation to remove Volcker Rule restrictions on banks under $10\\xa0billion in assets may or may\\nnot be adopted in a form that changes the applicability of the Volcker Rule to us.\\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could\\nadversely affect us.\\nWe have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the\\nfinancial services industry, including brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, and investment funds, our correspondent banks and other financial institutions. Our ability to engage in routine investment and banking\\ntransactions, as well as the quality and values of our investments in equity securities and obligations of other financial institutions, could be adversely affected by the actions, financial condition, and profitability of such other financial\\ninstitutions with which we deal, including, without limitation, the FHLB and our correspondent banks. At December\\xa031, 2017, the amortized cost of the Bank’s investments in FHLB and our correspondent bank’s common stock was\\napproximately $1.1\\xa0million. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of shared credits, trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more\\nfinancial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems, losses of depositor, creditor or counterparty confidence in certain institutions and could lead to losses or defaults by other\\ninstitutions, and in some cases, failure of such institutions. Any losses, defaults by, or failures of, the institutions we do business with could adversely affect our holdings of the debt of and equity in, such other institutions, our participation\\ninterests in loans originated by other institutions, and our business, including our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.\\nNonperforming and\\nsimilar assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\\nAt December\\xa031,\\n2017, our nonaccrual loans totaled $3.0\\xa0million, or 0.66% of total loans. We had no properties held as other real estate owned at December\\xa031, 2017. Our\\nnon-performing\\nassets may adversely affect our\\nnet income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO and these assets require higher loan administration and other costs, thereby adversely affecting our income. Decreases in the value of these assets, or the\\nunderlying collateral, or in the related borrowers’ performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nIn addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in\\nnonperforming loans in the future.\\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.\\nWe periodically review our allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality\\nindicators, including past\\ncharge-off\\nexperience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. We cannot be certain that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses\\nin our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets, and changes in borrower behaviors. If the credit quality of our customer base\\nmaterially decreases, if the risk profile of the market, industry or group of customers changes materially or weaknesses in the real estate markets worsen, borrower payment behaviors change, or if our allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our\\nbusiness, financial condition, including our liquidity and capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) adopted Accounting Standards Update\\n(“ASU”)\\nNo.\\xa02016-13\\n“Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” on June\\xa016, 2016, which changed the loss model\\nto take into account current expected credit losses, or “CECL”. ASU\\nNo.\\xa02016-13\\nis effective for our fiscal year beginning January\\xa01, 2020. We have not yet determined how ASU\\nNo.\\xa02016-13\\nwill affect our results of operations and financial condition. Any such impact could be material.\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nChanges in the real estate markets, including the secondary market for residential mortgage loans, may\\ncontinue to adversely affect us.\\nThe effects of the CFPB changes to mortgage and servicing rules effective at the beginning of 2014, the CFPB’s\\nTRID rules for closed end credit transactions secured by real property that became effective in October 2015, enforcement actions, reviews and settlements, changes in the securitization rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, including the risk retention\\nrules that became effective on December\\xa024, 2016, and the Basel III Rules could have serious adverse effects on the mortgage markets and our mortgage operations.\\nThe TRID rules have affected our current and proposed mortgage business and have increased our costs as a result of our compliance efforts. In addition, the\\nCFPB’s final regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, which require that lenders determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan, which became effective in January 2014, have limited the secondary market for and\\nliquidity of many mortgage loans that are not “qualified mortgages.”\\nIncreasing interest rates and the 2017 Tax Act’s limitations on the\\ndeductibility of residential mortgage interest and state and local property and other taxes could adversely affect consumer behaviors and the volumes of housing sales, mortgage and home equity loan originations, as well as the value and liquidity of\\nresidential property held as collateral by lenders such as the Bank, and the secondary markets for residential loans. Acquisition, construction and development loans for residential development may be similarly adversely affected.\\nThe Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, have been in conservatorship since\\nSeptember 2008. Minimal capital, the levels of risky assets at the Federal Housing Administration, or the FHA, and its relatively low capital and reserves for losses, the current levels of home sales, and the risks of interest rates increasing\\nmaterially from historically low levels, as well as the 2017 Tax Act, could also have serious adverse effects on the mortgage markets and our mortgage operations. Such adverse effects could include, among other things, price reductions in single\\nfamily home values, further adversely affecting the liquidity and value of collateral securing commercial loans for residential acquisition, construction and development, as well as residential mortgage loans that we hold, mortgage loan originations\\nand gains on sale of mortgage loans. In the event our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to cover such losses, if any, our earning, capital and liquidity could be adversely affected.\\nSignificant ongoing disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans have limited the market for and liquidity of most mortgage loans other\\nthan conforming Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA loans. Declines in real estate values, low home sales volumes, financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses or reduced incomes, interest rate increases, generally, including resets on\\nadjustable rate mortgage loans, maturities of second lien mortgages or other factors have adversely affected borrowers during recent years. Higher interest rate and changes in mortgage loan rules, could result in fewer mortgage originations, higher\\ndelinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, as well as increased regulation capital requirement which would adversely affect our financial condition, including capital and liquidity, and our results of operations. In the event our\\nallowance for loan losses is insufficient to cover such losses, if any, our earnings, capital and liquidity could be adversely affected. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest purchasers of residential mortgage loans, remain in federal\\nconservatorship and the timing and effects of their resolution cannot be predicted.\\nWeaknesses in real estate markets may adversely affect the length of\\ntime and costs required to manage and dispose of, and the values realized from the sale of our OREO.\\nWe may be contractually obligated to repurchase\\nmortgage loans we sold to third parties on terms unfavorable to us.\\nAs a routine part of its business, the Company originates mortgage loans that it\\nsubsequently sells in the secondary market, including to governmental agencies and GSEs, such as Fannie Mae. In connection with the sale of these loans, the Company makes customary representations and warranties, the breach of which may result in\\nthe Company being required to repurchase the loan or loans. Furthermore, the amount paid may be greater than the fair value of the loan or loans at the time of the repurchase. Although mortgage loan repurchase requests made to us have been limited,\\nif these increased notwithstanding new repurchase procedures adopted in late 2015 and early 2016 by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we may have to establish reserves for possible repurchases and\\nadversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nMortgage servicing rights requirements may change and require us to incur additional costs and risks.\\nThe CFPB adopted new residential mortgage servicing standards in January 2014 that add additional servicing requirements, increase our required servicer\\nactivities and delay foreclosures, among other things. These may adversely affect our costs to service residential mortgage loans, and together with the Basel III Rules, may decrease the returns on our MSRs. The CFPB and the bank regulators continue\\nto bring enforcement actions and develop proposals, rules and practices that could increase the costs of providing mortgage servicing. This could reduce our income from servicing these types of loans and make it more difficult and costly to timely\\nrealize the value of collateral securing such loans upon a borrower default.\\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac restructuring may adversely affect the\\nmortgage markets and our sales of mortgages we originated.\\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship, and although legislation has been\\nintroduced at various times to restructure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to take them out of conservatorship and substantially change the way they conduct business in the future, no proposal has been enacted. Through 2017, all of Fannie Mae and Freddie\\nMac’s earnings above a specified capital reserve have been swept into the U.S. Treasury and have not been available to build Fannie Mae’s or Freddy Mac’s capital. At the end of 2017, the capital reserve was increased to\\n$3\\xa0billion for each of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac.\\nIn February 2018 Fannie Mae reported that the new Tax Act had reduced its deferred tax assets, and\\nthat it had a net worth deficit of $3.7\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2017. To eliminate its net worth deficit, Fannie Mae expects that the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, will submit a request to the Treasury\\nDepartment on the Fannie Mae’s behalf for $3.7\\xa0billion. Freddie Mac had a net worth deficit of $312\\xa0million at December\\xa031, 2017, and expects FHFA, will submit a draw request to the Treasury Department for $312\\xa0million.\\nSince Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dominate the residential mortgage markets, any changes in their structure and operations, as well as their respective\\ncapital, could adversely affect the primary and secondary mortgage markets, and our residential mortgage businesses, our results of operations and the returns on capital deployed in these businesses.\\nOur concentration of commercial real estate loans could result in further increased loan losses, and adversely affect our business, earnings, and financial\\ncondition.\\nCommercial real estate, or CRE, is cyclical and poses risks of possible loss due to concentration levels and risks of the assets being\\nfinanced, which include loans for the acquisition and development of land and residential construction. The federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance in 2006 on “Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending.” The guidance\\ndefines CRE loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development and construction (including\\n1-4\\nfamily residential construction), multi-family property, and\\nnon-farm\\nnonresidential property, where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50% or more of the source of\\nrepayment comes from third party,\\nnon-affiliated,\\nrental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. Loans to REITs and unsecured loans to developers that closely\\ncorrelate to the inherent risks in commercial real estate markets would also be considered CRE loans under the guidance. Loans on owner occupied commercial real estate are generally excluded. We had 61.1% of our portfolio in CRE loans, as defined by\\nthe Federal Reserve, at\\nyear-end\\n2017 compared to 60.7% at\\nyear-end\\n2016. The banking regulators continue to give CRE lending scrutiny and further addressed their\\nconcerns over CRE activity in December 2016, requiring banks with higher levels of CRE loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as higher levels of allowances for\\npossible losses and capital levels as a result of CRE lending growth and exposures. Lower demand for CRE, and reduced availability of, and higher costs for, CRE lending could adversely affect our CRE loans and sales of our OREO, and therefore our\\nearnings and financial condition, including our capital and liquidity.\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nOur ability to realize our deferred tax assets may be reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable\\nincome from our operations and tax planning strategies do not support this amount, and the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards realizable for income tax purposes may be reduced under Section\\xa0382 of the Internal Revenue Code by sales of\\nour capital securities.\\nWe are allowed to carry-back losses for two years for Federal income tax purposes. As of December\\xa031, 2017, we had net\\ndeferred tax assets of $0.8\\xa0million. These and future deferred tax assets may be further reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income from our operations and tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred\\ntax asset. The amount of net operating loss carry-forwards realizable for income tax purposes potentially could be further reduced under Section\\xa0382 of the Internal Revenue Code by a significant offering and/or other sales of our capital\\nsecurities. The Basel III Rules reduce the regulatory capital benefits of deferred tax assets, also.\\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to\\ncompete effectively in highly competitive markets.\\nThe East Alabama banking markets in which we do business are highly competitive and our future\\ngrowth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services in our markets with other local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions,\\nmortgage lenders, and securities and insurance brokerage firms. Marketplace lenders operating nationwide over the internet are growing rapidly. Many of our competitors offer products and services different from us, and have substantially greater\\nresources, name recognition and market presence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we are able to and have broader and more diverse\\ncustomer and geographic bases to draw upon. The Dodd-Frank Act allows others to branch into our markets more easily from other states. Failures of other banks with offices in our markets could also lead to the entrance of new, stronger competitors\\nin our markets.\\nOur success depends on local economic conditions where we operate.\\nOur success depends on the general economic conditions in the geographic markets we serve in Alabama. The local economic conditions in our markets have a\\nsignificant effect on our commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Adverse changes in the economic conditions of the Southeastern United\\nStates in general, or in one or more of our local markets could negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability.\\nOur cost of funds\\nmay increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates, inflation and competitive pressures.\\nAlthough the Federal Reserve has raised\\nthe target Federal Funds rate five times between December 2015 and January 2018 in accordance with efforts to normalize monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low over recent years, and the federal government continues large\\ndeficit spending. Our costs of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures, and potential inflation resulting from government deficit spending, the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and monetary\\npolicies. Traditionally, we have obtained funds principally through local deposits and borrowings from other institutional lenders. Generally, we believe local deposits are a cheaper and more stable source of funds than borrowings because interest\\nrates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders. Increases in interest rates could also cause consumers to shift their funds to more interest bearing instruments and to\\nincrease the competition for funds. While the Federal Reserve has indicated it will seek to gradually adjust low interest rates, interest rates could increase more than anticipated. See “Fiscal and Monetary Policy”. If customers move money\\nout of bank deposits and into other investment assets or from transaction deposits to higher interest bearing time deposits, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and\\nnet income. Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nOur profitability and liquidity may be affected by changes in interest rates and interest rate levels, the\\nshape of the yield curve and economic conditions.\\nOur profitability depends upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned\\non interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change where the interest we\\npay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments. Interest rates, and consequently our results of operations, are affected by general economic conditions (domestic and institutional) and fiscal and\\nmonetary policies, as well as expectations of these rates and policies and the shape of the yield curve. Our income is primarily driven by the spread between these rates. As a result, a steeper yield curve, meaning long-term interest rates are\\nsignificantly higher than short-term interest rates, would provide the Bank with a better opportunity to increase net interest income. Conversely, a flattening yield curve could pressure our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases\\nrelative to the spread we can earn on our assets. In addition, net interest income could be affected by asymmetrical changes in the different interest rate indexes, given that not all of our assets or liabilities are priced with the same index. The\\nnormalization of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, which is gradually increasing the Federal Reserve’s target Federal Funds rates and decreasing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities, may have unpredictable effects on the\\nshape of the yield curve and longer term interest rates.\\nThe production of mortgages and other loans and the value of collateral securing our loans, are\\ndependent on demand within the markets we serve, as well as interest rates.\\nIncreases in interest rates generally decrease the market values of\\nfixed-rate, interest-bearing investments and loans held, the value of mortgage and other loans produced and the value of loans sold, mortgage loan activities and the collateral securing our loans, and therefore may adversely affect our liquidity and\\nearnings, to the extent not offset by potential increases in our net interest margin.\\nThe 2017 Tax Act, including its fiscal stimulus limitations on the\\ndeductibility of residential mortgage interest and business interest expenses and other changes, could have mixed effects on economic activity and reduce the demand for loans and increase competition among lenders for loans. This Act could promote\\ninflation and higher interest rates.\\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank.\\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Company transactions with the Bank are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve\\nAct and Federal Reserve Regulation W. We depend upon the Bank’s earnings and dividends, which are limited by law and regulatory policies and actions, for cash to pay the Company’s debt and corporate obligations, and to pay dividends to our\\nshareholders. If the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company was terminated or limited, the Company’s liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, proceeds from loan repayments or sales, and other sources\\ncould have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, core and\\nnon-core\\ndeposits, and short- and long-term\\ndebt. We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity. We are also members of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, where we can obtain advances collateralized with eligible assets. There are other sources\\nof liquidity available to the Company or the Bank should they be needed, including our ability to acquire additional\\nnon-core\\ndeposits. We may be able, depending upon market conditions, to otherwise borrow\\nmoney or issue and sell debt and preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by\\nfactors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy in general. Our ability to borrow or obtain funding, if needed, could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as disruptions in the financial\\nmarkets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our\\nearnings.\\nWe and our subsidiaries are regulated by several regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Alabama Superintendent, the SEC and the\\nFDIC. Our success is affected by state and federal regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies, and the securities markets, and our costs of compliance could adversely affect our earnings. Banking regulations are primarily intended to\\nprotect depositors, not shareholders. The financial services industry also is subject to frequent legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes. The current President and the majority party in both houses of Congress have espoused\\nregulatory relief of the banking industry, but the nature, effects and timing of administrative and legislative change cannot be predicted. Federal bank regulatory agencies and the Treasury, as well as the Congress and the President, are evaluating\\nthe regulation of banks, other financial services providers and the financial markets and such changes, if any, could require us to maintain more capital and liquidity, and restrict our activities, which could adversely affect our growth,\\nprofitability and financial condition. Our consumer finance products, including residential mortgage loans, are subject to CFPB regulations and evolving standards reflecting CFPB releases, rule-making and enforcement actions.\\nChanges in accounting and tax rules applicable to banks could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These\\nchanges can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating\\nprior period financial statements\\n.\\nThe\\nFASB’s new guidance under ASU\\nNo.\\xa02016-13\\nincludes significant changes to the manner in which banks’ allowance for loan losses will be\\ncalculated beginning January\\xa01, 2020. Instead of using historical losses, the CECL model will be forward-looking with respect to expected losses over the life of loans and other instruments, and could materially affect our results of operations\\nand financial condition.\\nThe 2017 Tax Act may have adverse effects on certain of our customers and our businesses.\\nThe 2017 Tax Act will benefit the Bank by reducing the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate on its taxable income from 35% to 21%. This benefit may be\\ndiminished by the complexity, uncertainty and possible adverse effects of this legislation on certain of our borrowers, including limitations on the deductibility of:\\n•\\nresidential mortgage interest;\\n•\\nstate and local taxes, including property taxes; and\\n•\\nbusiness interest expenses.\\nThese changes may adversely affect borrowers’ cash flows and the values and\\nliquidity of collateral we hold to secure our loans. Fewer borrowers may be able to meet the CFPB’s “ability to repay” standards under the Truth in Lending Act and CFPB regulations, which include the borrower’s ability to pay\\ntaxes and assessments. Demand for loans by qualified borrowers could be reduced, and therefore competition among lenders could increase. Customer behaviors toward incurring and repaying debt could also change as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. As a\\nresult, the 2017 Tax Act could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations, at least before taking into account our lower U.S. corporate income tax rate.\\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, our financial condition, liquidity and\\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\\nWe and the Bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity,\\nincluding liquidity at the Company, as well as the Bank. If we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, including more rigorous requirements arising from our regulators’ implementation of Basel III, our financial condition,\\nliquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Our failure to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed”, including meeting the Basel III capital conservation buffers, for bank regulatory\\npurposes could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance, our ability to raise brokered deposits, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and our ability to make acquisitions, and we would no\\nlonger meet the requirements for becoming a financial holding company. These could also affect our ability to use discretionary bonuses to attract and retain quality personnel.\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nThe Dodd-Frank Act restricts our future issuance of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred\\nsecurities as eligible Tier 1 risk-based capital for purposes of the regulatory capital guidelines for bank holding companies.\\nWhile banks and thrift\\nholding companies with assets of less than $15\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2009 are permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before May\\xa019, 2010 as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act, only bank holding\\ncompanies with assets of less than $500\\xa0million are permitted to continue to issue trust preferred securities and have them count as Tier 1 capital. Accordingly, should we determine it is advisable, or should our regulators require us, based\\nupon new capital or liquidity regulations or otherwise, to raise additional Tier 1 risk-based capital, we would not be able to issue additional trust preferred securities or Company senior or secured debt, the proceeds of which could be downstreamed\\nas capital to the Bank. Instead, we would have to issue noncumulative preferred stock or common equity. To the extent we issue new equity, it could result in dilution to our shareholders. To the extent we issue preferred stock, dividends on the\\npreferred stock, unlike distributions paid on trust preferred securities, would not be tax deductible.\\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the\\nfuture, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on favorable terms.\\nWe anticipate that our current capital resources will satisfy\\nour capital requirements for the foreseeable future under currently effective rules. We may, however, need to raise additional capital to support our growth or currently unanticipated losses, or to meet the needs of our communities, resulting from\\nfailures or cutbacks by our competitors, and the Basel III Rules. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, among other things, on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are limited by events outside our\\ncontrol, and on our financial performance. If we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be limited.\\nFuture acquisitions and expansion activities may disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\\nWe regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities, including new branches and other offices. To the extent that we grow through\\nacquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. Acquiring other banks, branches, or businesses, as well as other geographic and product expansion activities, involve various risks including:\\n•\\nrisks of unknown or contingent liabilities;\\n•\\nunanticipated costs and delays;\\n•\\nrisks that acquired new businesses will not perform consistent with our growth and profitability expectations;\\n•\\nrisks of entering new markets or product areas where we have limited experience;\\n•\\nrisks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls and management, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures;\\n•\\nexposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions;\\n•\\ndifficulties, expenses and delays of integrating the operations and personnel of acquired institutions;\\n•\\npotential disruptions to our business;\\n•\\npossible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;\\n•\\npotential short-term decreases in profitability; and\\n•\\ndiversion of our management’s time and attention from our existing operations and business.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we also may consider the acquisition of other businesses. We expect that other banking and financial companies, many\\nof which have significantly greater resources, will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses. This competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Also, acquisitions are subject to various\\nregulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests, and regulatory approvals could contain conditions that reduce the\\nanticipated benefits of any transaction. Among other things, our regulators consider our capital, liquidity, profitability, regulatory compliance and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals. Any\\nacquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders’ equity per share of our common stock.\\nTechnological changes affect our business,\\nand we may have fewer resources than many competitors to invest in technological improvements.\\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid\\ntechnological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services and a growing demand for mobile and user-based banking applications. In addition to allowing us to analyze our customers better, the effective use of\\ntechnology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs, risks associated with fraud, and other operational risks. Largely unregulated “fintech” businesses have increased their participation in the lending\\nand payments business, and have increased competition in these businesses. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that meet our customers’ preferences and create additional\\nefficiencies in operations, while avoiding cyber-attacks and disruptions, and data breaches. We may need to make significant additional capital investments in technology, including cyber and data security, and we may not be able to effectively\\nimplement new technology-driven products and services, or such technology may prove less effective than anticipated. Many larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and, increasingly,\\nnon-banking\\nfirms are using technology to compete with traditional lenders for loans and other banking services.\\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses.\\nOperational risks and losses can result from internal and external fraud; gaps or weaknesses in our risk management or internal audit procedures; errors by\\nemployees or third parties; failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules in the various jurisdictions where we do business or\\nhave customers; failures in the models we generate and rely on; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical, telecommunications or other essential utility outages; business continuity and data security system\\nfailures, including those caused by computer viruses, cyberattacks, unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or, upgrades to existing systems or inadequate access to data or poor response capabilities in light of\\nsuch business continuity and data security system failures; or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls, including those of our suppliers or counterparties. In addition, we face certain risks inherent in the ownership and operation of our\\nbank premises and other real-estate, including liability for “slip and fall” and other accidents on our properties. Although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial resources are devoted to developing\\nefficient procedures, identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff, it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us.\\n28\\nTable of Contents\\nPotential gaps in our risk management policies and internal audit procedures may leave us exposed unidentified\\nor unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.\\nOur enterprise risk management and internal audit program is designed to mitigate\\nmaterial risks and loss to us. We have developed and continue to develop risk management and internal audit policies and procedures to reflect the ongoing review of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies\\nand procedures may not be comprehensive and may not identify every risk to which we are exposed, and our internal audit process may fail to detect such weaknesses or deficiencies in our risk management framework. Many of our methods for managing\\nrisk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior to model or project potential future exposure. Models used by our business are based on assumptions and projections. These models may not operate properly or our inputs\\nand assumptions may be inaccurate. As a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information\\nregarding markets, clients, or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete,\\nup-to-date\\nor properly evaluated. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will closely follow our risk management policies and procedures, nor can there be any assurance that our\\nrisk management policies and procedures will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit our exposures based on our assessments. In addition, we may have to implement more extensive and perhaps different risk management policies and\\nprocedures under pending regulations.\\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our reputation and\\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\\n.\\nVarious federal and state laws enforced by the bank\\nregulators and other agencies protect the privacy and security of customers\\nnon-public\\npersonal information. Many of our employees have access to, and routinely process personal information of clients through\\na variety of media, including information technology systems. We rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, us and our employees. It is\\npossible that an employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. Such personal data could also be compromised by third party\\nhackers via intrusions into our systems or those of service providers or persons we do business with such as credit bureaus, data processors and merchants who accept credit or debit cards for payment. If we fail to maintain adequate internal\\ncontrols, or if our employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. Such internal control inadequacies or\\nnon-compliance\\ncould materially damage our reputation, lead to civil or criminal penalties, or both, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nOur information systems may experience interruptions and security breaches.\\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems, including those provided by third-party service providers, to conduct our business. Any failure,\\ninterruption, or security breach of these systems could result in failures or disruptions which could affect our customers’ privacy and our customer relationships, generally. Our systems and networks, as well as those of our third-party service\\nproviders, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Although we do not believe that we and our third-party service providers have\\nbeen subject to a cyber-attack, other financial service institutions and their service providers have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks, including use\\nof stolen access credentials, malware, ransomware, phishing, structured query language injection attacks and distributed\\ndenial-of-service\\nattacks, among other means.\\nSuch cyber-attacks may also be directed at disrupting the operations of public companies or their business partners, which are intended to effect unauthorized fund transfers, obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data,\\ndisable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, and\\nwe may be subject to these types of attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks\\nand could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\\n29\\nTable of Contents\\nDespite our cybersecurity policies and procedures and our Board of Director’s and Management’s efforts\\nto monitor and ensure the integrity of our and our service providers’ systems, we may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, nor may we be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The\\ntechniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist\\norganizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as the use of mobile banking and other internet-based products and services continues to grow.\\nSecurity breaches or failures may have serious adverse financial and other consequences, including significant legal remediation costs, disruption of\\noperations, misappropriation of confidential information, damage to systems operated by us or our third-party service providers, as well as damaging our customers and our counterparties. In addition to the immediate costs of any failure,\\ninterruption or security breach, including those at our third-party service providers, these events could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation\\nand possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\\nSevere\\nweather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could have significant effects on our business.\\nSevere weather and\\nnatural disasters, including hurricanes, tornados, drought and floods, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could have a significant effect on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base;\\nimpair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established\\ndisaster recovery and business continuity policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nOur associates may take excessive risks which could negatively affect our financial condition and business.\\nAs a banking enterprise, we are in the business of accepting certain risks. The associates who conduct our business, including executive officers and other\\nmembers of management, sales intermediaries, investment professionals, product managers, and other associates, do so in part by making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk. We endeavor, in the design and implementation of our\\ncompensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our associates incentives to take excessive risks; however, associates may take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ\\ncontrols and procedures designed to monitor associates’ business decisions and prevent them from taking excessive risks, and to prevent employee misconduct, these controls and procedures may not be effective. If our associates take excessive\\nrisks, the impact of those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.\\nWe\\nmay be unable to attract and retain key people to support our business.\\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key\\npeople. We compete with other financial services companies for people primarily on the basis of compensation, support services and financial position. Intense competition exists for key employees with demonstrated ability, and we may be unable to\\nhire or retain such employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions\\ninvolving key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business due to loss of their skills, knowledge of our business, their years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees.\\nProposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements\\ninto which we may enter with certain of our employees and officers. In addition, proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act would prohibit the payment of “excessive compensation” to our executives. These restrictions could negatively affect\\nour ability to compete with other companies in recruiting and retaining key personnel.\\n30\\nTable of Contents\\nOur ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders in the future is subject to profitability, capital,\\nliquidity and regulatory requirements and these limitations may prevent us from paying dividends in the future.\\nCash available to pay dividends to\\nour shareholders is derived primarily from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, will continue to be subject to and limited by the results of\\noperations of our subsidiaries and our need to maintain appropriate liquidity and capital at all levels of our business consistent with regulatory requirements and the needs of our businesses. See “Supervision and Regulation”.\\nA limited trading market exists for our common shares, which could lead to price volatility.\\nYour ability to sell or purchase common shares depends upon the existence of an active trading market for our common stock. Although our common stock is\\nquoted on the Nasdaq Global Market, the volume of trades on any given day has been limited historically. As a result, you may be unable to sell or purchase shares of our common stock at the volume, price and time that you desire. Additionally,\\nwhether the purchase or sales prices of our common stock reflects a reasonable valuation of our common stock also is affected by an active trading market, and thus the price you receive for a thinly-traded stock such as common stock, may not reflect\\nits true or intrinsic value. The limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading\\nmarket.\\n31\\nTable of Contents', 'Could not parse', \"Item\\xa01A. Risk Factors\\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nOur Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, and are subject to unique risks.\\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services.\\nThe commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. Traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. In addition, availability of financing to non-U.S. customers depends in part on the Export-Import Bank of the United States being fully operational. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate.\\nCommercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines.\\nWe can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.\\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.\\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability.\\nWe have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 787-10 and 777X aircraft. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs,\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nidentifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.\\nOur commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs.\\nIf our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues.\\nDeveloping and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States Department of Defense (\\nU.S. DoD\\n). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment, U.S. foreign policy, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills.\\nIn addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. Accordingly, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure.\\nIn addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the\\nU.S. DoD\\nand other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations committees included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as F/A-18, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache,\\nKC-46A Tanker\\nand P-8 programs, in the final FY2017 appropriation and in their FY2018 bills, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2018 and beyond will affect Boeing’s programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.\\nIn addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the\\nU.S. DoD\\nto continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the\\nU.S. DoD\\ncustomer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\\nIn\\n2017\\n,\\n31%\\nof our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales (FMS) through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\\nNew procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.\\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts.\\nThe U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In addition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.\\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S. government contracts.\\nU.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.\\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.\\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately\\n65%\\nand\\n77%\\nof their\\n2017\\nrevenues from fixed-price contracts. While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling\\n$471 million\\non the\\nUSAF KC-46A Tanker\\ncontract, primarily driven by additional costs attributable to certification and incorporating changes into low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nimpacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.\\nFixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15,\\nUSAF KC-46A Tanker\\n, and commercial and military satellites.\\nWe enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.\\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately\\n35%\\nand\\n23%\\nof their\\n2017\\nrevenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise.\\xa0Programs whose contracts are primarily cost-type\\xa0include\\nGMD\\n, Proprietary and\\nSLS\\nprograms.\\nWe enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.\\nContracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at risk\\xa0if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit incentive fees\\xa0we ultimately expect to realize\\xa0is recognized as revenue in the construction period. If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required to\\xa0provide refunds to the customer\\xa0and incur significant charges.\\nOur ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.\\nWe rely on other companies including U.S. and non-U.S. subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. In addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the supplier’s control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.\\nWe use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\\nContract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\ncosts and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers’ assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.\\nWith respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a)\\xa0the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b)\\xa0the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c)\\xa0the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance.\\nBecause of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. For additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting/Program Accounting” on pages\\n41\\n–\\n43\\nand Note\\n1\\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages\\n52\\n–\\n64\\nof this Form\\xa010-K.\\nCompetition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales.\\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. In our Commercial Airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our\\nU.S. DoD\\nand non-U.S. will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share.\\n10\\nTable of Contents\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.\\nIn\\n2017\\n, non-U.S. customers, which includes FMS, accounted for approximately\\n55%\\nof our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\\n•\\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\\n•\\nU.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;\\n•\\nfluctuations in international currency exchange rates;\\n•\\nvolatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders;\\n•\\nthe complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;\\n•\\nthe uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States;\\n•\\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;\\n•\\nimposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;\\n•\\nthe difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;\\n•\\ncompliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and\\n•\\nunforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.\\nWhile the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.\\nUnauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business.\\nWe face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in\\xa0significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. In addition, we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers. Many of these customers face similar security threats. If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.\\nThe outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\\nWe are involved in a number of litigation matters. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits, or future lawsuits, could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we\\n11\\nTable of Contents\\nare subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the U.S. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\\nA significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.\\nA significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions. Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft, and among customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected.\\nWe may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts.\\nWe depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. As of\\nDecember 31, 2017 and 2016\\n, our airplane financing commitments totaled\\n$10,221 million\\nand\\n$14,847 million\\n. If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.\\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. government. The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. For example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. While some of these products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.\\nBusiness disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.\\nOur business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.\\nSome of our and our suppliers’ workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.\\nApproximately\\n52,000\\nemployees, which constitute\\n37%\\nof our total workforce, were union represented as of\\nDecember 31, 2017\\n. We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production. We may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with\\n10\\nU.S. labor organizations and\\n7\\nnon-U.S. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions’ requirements without impacting our financial condition. The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.\\nSubstantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders’ equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.\\nThe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the\\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act\\nand discretionary contributions to improve the plans\\n'\\nfunded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions\\ncould have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders\\n'\\nequity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\nestimates of the level of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see\\n“\\nManagement\\n'\\ns Discussion and Analysis\\n-\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\n-\\nPension Plans\\n”\\non page\\n43\\nof this Form 10-K. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.\\nOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.\\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. In some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. In other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. For additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see Note\\n11\\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements.\"]\n"
