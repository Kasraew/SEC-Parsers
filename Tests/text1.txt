Transactions with Related Persons
 
Except as disclosed below, for transactions with our executive officers and directors, please see the disclosure under “
Item 11. Executive Compensation.
 
Except as set out below, since the beginning of the Company’s last fiscal year, there have been no transactions, or currently proposed transactions, in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any of the following people had or will have a direct or indirect material interest:
 
 
·
Any director or executive officer of the Company;
 
 
 
 
·
Any immediate family member of a director or executive officer of the Company; and
 
 
 
 
·
Any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares carrying more than 5% of the voting rights attached to our outstanding shares of common stock.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company borrowed $215,500 and $540,000, respectively in a series of cash payments from the Company’s CEO in exchange for the issuance of a promissory note. The promissory note is not secured by Company assets, does not bear interest and is due in full on March 15, 2025. The promissory note totaled $950,550 at December 31, 2023.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, a total of 200,001 shares of Class A Preferred Stock were issued to ours Vice President, Austen Lambrecht, the son of Greg Lambrecht, our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, one share of Class A Preferred Stock was issued to Greg Lambrecht and each of the two other members of the Company’s Board of Directors for services provided.
 
On February 28, 2024, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Austen Lambrecht, our Vice President. The term of the agreement is three years from the effective date, and will renew for six month periods automatically unless terminated by either party providing 90 days of prior written notice or for “Cause,” as defined in the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Lambrecht is entitled to an annual salary of $97,000. Mr. Lambrecht is also entitled to a bonus as determined by our Board of Directors, healthcare (once established by the Company), reimbursement of expenses, and 20 vacation days per year. Also, as an inducement to enter into the agreement, Mr. Lambrecht was awarded 30 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
 
Director Independence
 
We are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be “independent” and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of “independent directors.”
 
We currently have not established any committees of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may designate from among its members an executive committee and one or more other committees in the future. We do not have a nominating committee or a nominating committee charter. Further, we do not have a policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by security holders. To date, other than as described above, no security holders have made any such recommendations. The entire Board of Directors performs all functions that would otherwise be performed by committees. Given the present size of our board it is not practical for us to have committees. If we are able to grow our business and increase our operations, we intend to expand the size of our board and allocate responsibilities accordingly.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of 1606 Corp. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and parent’s net investment, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the entity has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
Basis for Opinion
 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1606 Corp.
Notes to the Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
 
NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Corporate History
 
1606 Corp. (“1606” or the “Company”) was formed in February 2021 and was a division of Singlepoint Inc. (“Singlepoint”) until April 2021, when Singlepoint spun off 1606, whereby each holder of common stock and Class A preferred stock of Singlepoint received one share of unregistered and restricted common stock or Class A preferred stock of the Company for each such share owned of Singlepoint.
 
Business
 
The Company is an AI Chatbot company specializing in merchandizing bot specifically built for the CBD industry.
 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has yet to achieve significant profitable operations and is dependent on its ability to raise capital from stockholders or other sources to sustain operations and to ultimately achieve viable operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company’s ability to continue in existence is dependent on its ability to develop its business and to achieve profitable operations. Since the Company does not anticipate achieving profitable operations and/or adequate cash flows in the near term, management will continue to pursue additional equity financing through private placements of the Company’s common stock.
 
NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation 
 
The financial statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).
 
Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.
 
Cash
 
Cash consists of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
 
Accounts Receivable and Credit Policy
 
Trade receivables due from customers are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date. Management of the Company considers all receivables collectable. Uncollectable accounts are charged to expense when the account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance is provided based upon a review of the individual accounts outstanding, prior history of uncollectable accounts receivable and existing economic conditions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is $
0

Inventory
 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and consist primarily of hemp products. The Company’s inventory as of December 31, 2023, and 2022 consisted of finished hemp products. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates inventories for excess quantities, obsolescence, or shelf-life expiration. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product, projections of future demand and the risk of technological or competitive obsolescence for products. To the extent that management determines there is excess or obsolete inventory or quantities with a shelf life that is too near its expiration for the Company to reasonably expect that it can sell those products prior to their expiration, the Company adjusts the carrying value of this inventory to the lower of cost or market. No such adjustments were deemed necessary during the periods presented.
 
Investments
 
Investments are recorded at cost and evaluated for impairment each balance sheet date. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company wrote-off investments of $
15,000
50,000
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Company, which has adopted ASC 606 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”,
 
Cost of Goods Sold and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
 
Costs associated with the production and procurement of product are included in cost of goods sold, including shipping and handling costs such as inbound freight costs, purchasing, and receiving costs, inspection costs and other product procurement related charges. All other expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, as the predominant expenses associated therewith are general and administrative in nature.
 
Income taxes
 
Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates.
 
Tax benefits are recognized from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority and based upon the technical merits of the tax position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. An unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, is presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed.
 
Net Loss Per Common Share 
 
Basic loss per share data is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share data is computed using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common-equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common-equivalent shares consist of shares that would be issued upon the exercise of stock options and other common stock equivalents, computed using the treasury stock method, and are excluded from the calculation of weighted average dilutive common shares, to the extent they are issued and outstanding, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The number of potentially dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share were 2,265,400 related to the Company’s Class A preferred stock. These shares were excluded from the diluted per share calculation because the effect of including these potential shares was antidilutive.

Fair Value Measurement 
 
ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement”, requires that certain financial instruments be recognized at their fair values at our balance sheet dates. However, other financial instruments, such as debt obligations, are not required to be recognized at their fair values, but GAAP provides an option to elect fair value accounting for these instruments. GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair values of all financial instruments, regardless of whether they are recognized at their fair values or carrying amounts in our balance sheets. For financial instruments recognized at fair value, GAAP requires the disclosure of their fair values by type of instrument, along with other information, including changes in the fair values of certain financial instruments recognized in income or other comprehensive income. For financial instruments not recognized at fair value, the disclosure of their fair values is provided below under “Financial Instruments.”
 
Nonfinancial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and nonfinancial liabilities are recognized at their carrying amounts in the Company’s balance sheets. GAAP does not permit nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be remeasured at their fair values. However, GAAP requires the remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to their fair values upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the impairment of property, plant and equipment. In addition, if such an event occurs, GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair value of the asset or liability along with other information, including the gain or loss recognized in income in the period the remeasurement occurred.
 
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
 
Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or
 
Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
 
The Company did not have any Level 1 or Level 2 assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 or 2023. The Derivative liabilities are Level 3 fair value measurements.
 
The following is a summary of activity of Level 3 liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2023:

NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES
 
The Company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 
“Income Taxes”
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company has a net operating loss carryforward, however, due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from this net operating loss carryforward.
 
The components of income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, consist of the following:

Legal Proceedings and Other Claims
 
From time to time, we are a party to claims and actions for matters arising out of our business operations. We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings and other claims in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss, or an additional loss, may have been incurred and determine if accruals are appropriate. If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss can be made for disclosure. Although the outcome of claims and litigation is inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that our financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by the resolution of a claim or legal proceeding. Legal expenses related to defense, negotiations, settlements, rulings, and advice of outside legal counsel are expensed as incurred.
