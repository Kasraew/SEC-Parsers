BUSINESS
(a) General Development of Business.
Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation is both an operating company and a holding company with both direct and indirect subsidiaries. A complete list of
Roanoke Electric Steel&#146;s subsidiaries is set forth on Exhibit No. 21 to this Form 10-K. For purposes of this Form 10-K, the defined term &#147;Registrant&#148; will, depending on the context, refer to Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation and its
subsidiaries on a combined basis or refer to Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation as an operating company.
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003, the Registrant continued for the most part to operate its business as it has the past four years by
manufacturing merchant steel bar products and specialty steel sections, fabricating open-web steel joists and concrete reinforcing steel, and extracting scrap steel and other metals from junked automobiles and other waste materials.
On December 16, 1998, the Registrant acquired all of the outstanding common
shares of Steel of West Virginia, Inc. (&#147;SWVA&#148;), a Huntington, West Virginia steel manufacturer, for approximately $117.1 million, including the assumption of approximately $52.3 million of indebtedness. Upon merger, SWVA became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Roanoke Electric Steel Corporation. On the date of acquisition the Registrant closed on secured credit facilities, which included a $150,000,000 seven year term loan, through a syndicated bank group. The term loan was used
to purchase all of the outstanding capital stock of SWVA, and refinance both the existing term debt of the Registrant and most of SWVA&#146;s bank debt assumed through the merger. SWVA operates a mini-mill in Huntington, West Virginia, and steel
fabrication facilities in Huntington and Memphis, Tennessee, while custom designing and manufacturing special steel products principally for use in the construction of truck trailers, industrial lift trucks, off-highway construction equipment (such
as
</item></part><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;">(con&#146;d.)
bulldozers and graders), manufactured housing, guardrail posts and mining equipment. The Registrant and SWVA do not generally compete as regards customers
and products. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of operations and cash flows were reflected in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, and the acquired assets and liabilities were
included in the 1999 consolidated balance sheet at values based on a purchase price allocation, rendered through appraisals and other evaluations.
The other subsidiaries of the Registrant, Shredded Products Corporation, John W. Hancock, Jr., Inc., Socar, Incorporated and RESCO Steel Products
Corporation, have had no material changes in operations or in the mode of conducting their business for the past five years.
(b) Financial Information about Industry Segments.
The Registrant&#146;s business consists of one industry segment or line of business, which is the extracting of scrap metal from discarded automobiles and
the manufacturing, fabricating and marketing of merchant steel bar products and specialty steel sections, reinforcing bars, open-web steel joists and billets. The industry segment consists of three classes of products - merchant steel products and
specialty steel sections, fabricated bar joists and reinforcing bars, and billets.

(c) Narrative Description of Business.
(1) (i) The Registrant manufactures merchant steel products consisting of Angles, Plain Rounds, Flats, Channels and
Reinforcing Bars of various lengths and sizes. The principal markets for the Registrant&#146;s products are steel fabricators and steel service centers. The products are distributed directly to customers from orders solicited by a paid sales staff
of the Registrant.
The Registrant&#146;s subsidiary, Shredded
Products Corporation, is involved in the extraction of scrap iron and steel and other metals from junked automobiles and other waste materials. Almost all of the ferrous material is used by the Parent as raw materials. The non-ferrous metals are
sold to unrelated purchasers.
Two other subsidiaries, John W.
Hancock, Jr., Inc. and Socar, Incorporated, are engaged in the manufacturing of long- and short-span steel joists. Joists are open-web steel horizontal supports for floors and roofs, used primarily in the construction of commercial and industrial
buildings such as shopping centers, factories, warehouses, hospitals, schools, office buildings, nursing homes, and the like. Joists are cheaper and lighter than structural steel or reinforced concrete. The joists are distributed by these
subsidiaries to their customers from orders solicited by manufacturer&#146;s representatives and pursuant to successful bids placed directly by the subsidiaries.
The Registrant&#146;s subsidiary, RESCO Steel Products Corporation, fabricates concrete reinforcing steel by cutting and
bending rebars to contractors&#146; specifications. The rebars are distributed to contractors from orders solicited by a paid sales staff and pursuant to successful bids placed directly by the subsidiary.
The Registrant&#146;s subsidiary, Steel of West Virginia, Inc., operates both
a steel mini-mill which produces specialty steel sections, and fabrication facilities which add finishing operations to create custom-designed products placed directly into customers&#146; assembly lines. The niche markets supplied with these
products include truck trailers, industrial lift trucks, guardrail posts, manufactured housing, off-highway construction equipment, and mining equipment. These products are marketed by senior management and in-house sales representatives of SWVA,
whose sales efforts cover all of North America, and to a very small degree, certain other foreign markets.
The Roanoke and SWVA facilities both utilize electricity and natural gas as their power sources, with electric arc furnaces using electricty and with
reheat furnaces using natural gas. The arc furnaces are used in the actual melting of scrap steel (to produce billets), while the reheat furnaces are used to reheat the billets which are then rolled into a finished product.
(ii) The Registrant has not in fiscal 2003 introduced a new
product or begun to do business in a new industry segment that will require the investment of a material amount of assets or that otherwise is material.
</part><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;">(con&#146;d.)
(iii) The Registrant&#146;s main raw material, scrap steel, is supplied for the most
part by scrap dealers within a 300 mile radius of the mill. The majority of this raw material is purchased through the David J. Joseph Company, a scrap broker. The Shredded Products subsidiary supplies 10,000 to 15,000 tons of scrap per month.
Although scrap is generally available to the Registrant, the price of scrap steel is highly responsive to changes in demand, including demand in foreign countries as well as in the United States. The ability to maintain satisfactory profit margins
in times when scrap is relatively high priced is dependent upon the levels of steel prices, which are determined by market forces. Alloys and other materials needed for the melting process are provided by various domestic and foreign companies.
Shredded Products Corporation often experiences difficulty in
purchasing scrap automobiles at a satisfactory level. Competition from a number of other shredding operations and reluctance by dealers to sell scrap automobiles due to market conditions are the main causes. High offering prices generally increase
the supply; however, the increased cost to produce sometimes is very comparable to the price of similar scrap that can be purchased on the outside.
Substantially all of John W. Hancock, Jr., Inc.&#146;s steel components are purchased from the Parent, which is located conveniently nearby and, therefore
such components are generally available to the subsidiary as needed.
RESCO Steel Products Corporation purchases most of its steel components from suppliers within its market area, determined mainly by freight cost. Such components would be generally available to the subsidiary, since the Parent could produce
and supply this raw material, as needed.
Socar, Incorporated
receives most of its raw steel material from the Parent and other nearby suppliers, the determinant usually being freight cost. The availability of raw materials is not of major concern to the subsidiary, since the Parent could supply most of its
needs.
Steel of West Virginia, Inc., like the Parent, uses
scrap steel as its main raw material. Even though the purchase of steel scrap is subject to market conditions largely beyond its control, the subsidiary is located in a scrap surplus region, and therefore typically maintains less than a one month
supply of scrap, which keeps inventory costs to a minimum. Although one scrap dealer supplies 25% to 30% of SWVA&#146;s requirements, the subsidiary believes that a number of adequate sources of scrap and other raw materials that it uses are readily
available. SWVA has historically been successful in passing on scrap cost increases through price increases, however, the effect of market price competition has limited the subsidiary&#146;s ability to increase prices.
</part><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;">(con&#146;d.)
(iv) The Registrant currently holds no patents, trade marks, licenses, franchises or
concessions that are material to its business operations.
(v) The business of the Registrant is not seasonal.
(vi) The Registrant does not offer extended payment terms to its customers, nor is it normally required to carry significant amounts of
inventory to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers; although, at times market conditions have required the stockpiling of popular bar products for rapid delivery. Working capital practices generally remain constant during the course of
business except when the Registrant determines it to be advantageous to stockpile raw materials due to price considerations.
(vii) During fiscal year 2003, sales (tons) by the Registrant to Steel of West Virginia, Inc., John W. Hancock, Jr., Inc., Socar,
Incorporated and RESCO Steel Products Corporation, wholly-owned subsidiaries, were approximately 6%, 8%, 6% and 2% of the Registrant&#146;s total sales (tons), respectively. During fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the largest
nonaffiliated customer purchased approximately 4%, 4% and 5% of total sales (tons) &#151; 3%, 2% and 3% of total sales (dollars). The 2003 and 2001 customers purchased merchant bar products. The 2002 customer was the temporary return of the same
billet customer from 2000, where poor market conditions in the steel industry contributed to this customer&#146;s worsened financial condition and eventual bankruptcy. The bankruptcy resulted in a charge to bad debts of $2.6 million and contributed
to lower billet production levels. Poor market conditions prevented placing the lost tonnage with alternate sources. However, under normal market conditions, we would not expect the loss of any of these customers to have a materially adverse effect
on the Registrant and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. In addition, considerably more billet tons were used internally by SWVA, which helped to mitigate the lost billet sales.
(viii) The Registrant is of the opinion that the amount of its backlog is not generally material to an
understanding of the business. All backlog is shipped within the current fiscal year.
(ix) None of the business of the Registrant is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the Government.
(x) The
Registrant competes with steel-producing mills of similar size operative within its market region and also larger mills producing similar products. The market region in which the Registrant sells its products mainly consists of the majority of
states east of the Mississippi River. Price, including transportation cost, is the major determinant in securing business. Strong business conditions kept bar prices up during fiscal 1998, in spite of the temporary drop in merchant bar shipments,
caused by excess inventories at steel service centers. On December 16, 1998, the Registrant acquired 100% of the capital stock of Steel of West Virginia, Inc. (&#147;SWVA&#148;), a steel manufacturer, and 1999 results reflect the operations of SWVA
from the date of acquisition. The 1998 financial statements were not restated to include SWVA because the acquisition was
</part><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;">(con&#146;d.)
treated as a purchase for accounting purposes. Consequently, the significant increase in 1999 sales was due, primarily, to the inclusion of SWVA&#146;s
revenues in consolidated sales. Increased competition from foreign and domestic producers prompted industry-wide list price reductions for bar products at the beginning of fiscal 1999, and prices had not fully recovered by year end. Excess
inventories at steel service centers and a shortage of transportation equipment contributed to the slight reduction in tons shipped of bar products as bar markets were generally good throughout the year. Sales for 2000 were flat due, again, to the
acquisition of SWVA. Sales for the current year included SWVA&#146;s revenues for the entire period, whereas sales for 1999 included only the portion of SWVA&#146;s revenues from the date of acquisition. Average selling prices for bar and specialty
products increased slightly for 2000, but list prices had fallen sharply by the end of the year as a result of increased foreign and domestic competition. The increased competition and price uncertainty reduced order entry and backlogs and caused
decreases in both bar and specialty products shipments. Depressed economic conditions within the steel industry and certain niche markets resulted in the decline of 2001 sales. Selling prices for merchant bar and specialty steel products declined
due to heightened foreign and domestic competition. Shipments of specialty products were down, primarily, as a result of depressed economic conditions within major market segments. However, sales were positively affected by an increase in tons
shipped of merchant bar products, due to new product offerings and declining inventory levels at steel service centers. The reduction in 2002 sales was the result of continued poor business conditions and intensified competition. Shipments of
specialty steel products declined as a result of a further softening in demand within certain niche markets, while heightened competition and product mix brought selling prices for specialty steel lower. Demand for merchant bar products diminished
near year-end, resulting in the decline in bar shipments and contributing to the decline in sales for the year. While the selling price increase for bar products was small, it had a significant impact, in that it represented three increases in the
list prices for bar products during the year, in spite of poor market conditions and was, primarily, the result of rising scrap costs. Sales increased in 2003 as a result of both improved selling prices and increased tons shipped for merchant bar
products and specialty steel sections. The higher selling prices were principally due to continued rising scrap steel costs, which prompted several industry-wide price increases, as well as a strengthening in product demand. An improvement in market
conditions contributed to the higher shipment levels.
The
joist business is highly competitive. Due to similarity of product, relatively small price differences are often determinative in placing business. Ability to meet the customer&#146;s time requirements for delivery also is important in securing
business. Competing successfully becomes more difficult with the distance to point of delivery due to transportation costs. Continued favorable market conditions in the construction industry during
</part><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;">(con&#146;d.)
fiscal 1998 led to the increased shipments and level selling prices for fabricated products. Competitive conditions within the commercial construction
industry generally impact selling prices and shipment levels of fabricated products and were relatively favorable during 1999 as reflected in the higher selling prices. The reduced shipments were caused by minor factors other than competition as
business conditions continued strong and backlogs remained high. In 2000, the decline in fabricated products selling prices and shipments was caused by increased competition within the construction industry, even though business conditions continued
strong and backlogs were high. The decline in shipments was also affected by shortages of structural steel components. Economic conditions within the construction industry began to slide during 2001, as a result of increased competition, bringing
prices lower. Fabricated products shipments decreased as construction activity slowed dramatically during the latter part of the year, as a result of poor business conditions. Increased competitive pressures and much weaker construction activity
resulted in the decline in both selling prices and shipments of fabricated products for 2002. The slight increase in 2003 sales for fabricated products was due primarily to improved selling prices, which reacted to higher raw material costs.
Shipments of fabricated products decreased due to continued intense competition within the commercial construction industry.
Billets are semi-finished products used by the Registrant in its rolling mill process to manufacture various merchant bar products and specialty steel
sections. Excess billet production is sold to nonaffiliated customers who further fabricate the billets for various end uses. The significant increase in billet shipments for fiscal 1998 was attributable to record raw steel production, coupled with
unprecedented demand. Billet prices, which are normally triggered by price changes for scrap steel, our main raw material, were flat due to relatively unchanged scrap prices. A dramatic change in our market for billets during 1999 brought diminished
demand and a significant decline in tons shipped. Billet selling prices declined with sharp reductions in scrap prices. The dramatic reduction in billet shipments, again in 2000, and the continued drop in market conditions was attributable to the
financial condition and eventual bankruptcy of a major customer. Shipments to this customer were purposely curtailed to reduce our exposure to bad debts. Due to market conditions, we were not able to place the lost tonnage with alternate sources,
other than the tons used internally by SWVA. Billet selling prices were higher due to increased scrap prices. In 2001, billet shipments declined, due to poor market conditions and the loss of the major customer referred to earlier. Selling prices
for billets were lower, mostly attributable to falling scrap steel costs. Billet selling prices declined further in 2002, in spite of rising scrap costs, due to changes in the mix of products and customers. Billet shipments spiked during the year
with the temporary return of the major customer referred to above. Billet sales increased in 2003, as higher scrap steel costs brought improvements in billet pricing. Favorable market conditions also contributed to the increased billet shipments
during the year.
</part><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;">(con&#146;d.)
(xi) During the last three fiscal years, the Registrant was not involved in any
material research and development activities.
(xii) The Registrant, Shredded Products and SWVA are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, wastewater discharge, air emissions, furnace dust disposal and disposal of auto
fluff and other wastes. As with similar mills in the industry, the Registrant&#146;s and SWVA&#146;s furnaces are classified as generating hazardous waste because they produce certain types of dust containing lead, zinc and cadmium. The Registrant
now treats its electric arc furnace dust, a hazardous substance, utilizing its own stabilization process. Significant savings have been realized as this process replaced off-site and more expensive treatment methods that had been used through a
contract with an approved waste disposal firm. SWVA currently collects and handles its furnace waste through contracts with a company which reclaims, from the waste dust, certain materials and recycles or disposes of the remainder. Shredded Products
operates an approved landfill for use in disposal of its waste products associated with its auto shredding operations. The Registrant believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. However, future
changes in regulations may require expenditures which could adversely affect earnings in subsequent years.
The Registrant has constructed over the years pollution control equipment at a net aggregate cost of over $10,200,000. Annual operating expenses and
depreciation of all pollution control equipment and waste disposal costs are in excess of $2,700,000 in the aggregate. Additional future capital expenditures, for pollution control and waste disposal equipment, are presently estimated to be less
than $10,000,000, and is in connection with future expansion, and not to address any current circumstances or issues. This expansion and, thus, the expenditures have been delayed for both economic and financial reasons, and will be completed and
funded, as the Registrant&#146;s financial resources permit. Adoption of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, or any other environmental concerns, is not anticipated to have a materially adverse effect on the Registrant&#146;s operations, capital
resources or liquidity, nor should any incremental increase in capital expenditures occur due to the Act.
See Note 8, &#147;Commitments and Contingent Liabilities&#148;, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Registrant&#146;s 2003
Annual Report to Stockholders, filed as an Exhibit to this Form 10-K.
(xiii) At October 31, 2003, the Registrant employed 454 persons at its Roanoke plant. The Registrant&#146;s subsidiaries, Steel of West Virginia, Inc., John W. Hancock, Jr., Inc., Socar, Incorporated, Shredded
Products Corporation and RESCO Steel Products Corporation employed 475, 234, 233, 57 and 43 persons, respectively.
</part><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;">(con&#146;d.)
(d) Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales.
When the Registrant&#146;s billet production exceeds its required needs, this
semi-finished product is offered for sale. During past years, a portion of the excess billets has been sold to brokers who represent foreign purchasers. In 2003, export (billet) sales to China amounted to $4,276,000 at slightly below break-even
margins. During fiscal years 2002 and 2001, the Registrant did not make any foreign sales of excess billets. However, the SWVA subsidiary sold a small percentage of its rolled products to foreign markets during these years. The information required
by this paragraph by geographical area, as to foreign and domestic operations, is not provided since it is identical to the table in paragraph (b) with virtually all information pertaining to the United States.
<item title="ITEM 2.&#10;PROPERTIES" parsing_type="item;">ITEM&#160;2.

The various buildings are of modern design, well-maintained, and suitable and adequate for the
requirements of the business. The Registrant believes that its facilities are being adequately used, that it does not have any excess capacity and that it has no excess or obsolete facilities.
<item title="ITEM 3.&#10;LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" parsing_type="item;">ITEM&#160;3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Registrant is a participant with other steel producers in class action litigation against manufacturers of graphite electrodes, which are used in the
melting phase of steel production. The suit alleges that the defendant manufactures violated the antitrust laws by fixing prices during the period July 1, 1992 through June 30, 1998. The Registrant is not one of the lead plaintiffs or otherwise a
representative of the class in this litigation. As a member of the class, the Registrant receives only that information forwarded to it by the class representatives or counsel.
Certain of the defendants have entered into court approved settlements, resulting in partial distributions received by the
Registrant during the period 1999 through 2003 of $4,251,088. The Registrant recognized the revenue upon realization.
Two cases remain unsettled and class counsel holds an unspecified amount of undistributed settlement funds. The Registrant expects to receive additional
distributions, but does not anticipate the mounts to be material and does not know the precise timing of such future distributions. Because the Registrant does not expect any future amounts to be material, it does not believe that disclosure of the
&#147;gain contingency&#148; is warranted. As under its existing policy, the Registrant will recognize the revenue upon realization. If the Registrant determines that future distributions might be material, it will disclose the &#147;gain
contingency&#148; while exercising the caution provided in paragraph 17 of SFAS 5.

&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders.
The Registrant has no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The specific information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the information under the headings &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; and &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in the 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders.
As disclosed in Note 7 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Registrant engages in transactions in various
derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity from time to time, when appropriate. At October 31, 2003, the Registrant&#146;s financial instruments were not exposed to significant market risk due to foreign currency exchange risk,
commodity price risk, equity price risk, or interest rate risk. However, interest rates and various commodity prices could pose future risks in certain market conditions. As to interest rate risk, the Registrant performed a materiality assessment as
of October 31, 2003, and assumed a 10% adverse change in interest rates applied to its floating rate debt. The analysis indicated that such a change would not have a material effect on the Registrant&#146;s consolidated results of operations or on
the fair value of its risk-sensitive financial instruments. As to commodity price risk, a hypothetical 10% drop in the market price of natural gas would not have a materially adverse effect on the Registrant&#146;s consolidated results of operations
or on the fair value of its natural gas derivative contracts at October 31, 2003.
