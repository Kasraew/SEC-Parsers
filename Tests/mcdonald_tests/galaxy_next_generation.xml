<root><part title="PART I" parsing_type="part;"><item title="ITEM 1. BUSINESS." parsing_type="item;"><company_defined_section title="Business Overview" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Galaxy is a manufacturer and U.S. distributor of interactive learning technology hardware
and software that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully collaborative instructional environment. Galaxy's product
offerings include Galaxy's own private-label interactive touch screen panel, its own Intercom, Bell, and Paging solution, as well as an
audio amplification line of products that is currently supported by OEM relationships. Galaxy's distribution channel consists of a direct
sales model, as well as approximately 37 resellers across the U.S. who primarily sell the products offered by Galaxy within the commercial
and educational market. Galaxy does not control where the resellers focus their reselling efforts; however, the K-12 education market
is the largest customer base for Galaxy products comprising nearly 90% of Galaxy's sales. In addition, Galaxy's OEM division also manufacturers
products for other vendors in its industry and white labels the products under other brands.
We believe the market space for interactive technology in the classroom is a perpetual highway
of business opportunity, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic as school systems have sought to expand their ability to operate
remotely. Public and private school systems are in a continuous race to modernize their learning environments. Our goal is to be an early
provider of the best and most modern technology available.
We are striving to become the leader in the market for interactive flat panel technology,
associated software, and peripheral devices for classrooms. Our goal is to provide an intuitive system to enhance the learning environment
and create easy to use technology for the teacher, increasing student engagement and achievement. Our products are developed and backed
by a management team with more than 30 combined years in the classroom technology space.
We were originally organized as a corporation in 2001. Our principal executive offices are
located at 285 Big A Road Toccoa, Georgia 30577, and our telephone number is (706) 391-5030. Our website address is
www.galaxynext.us .
Information contained in our website does not form part of this Annual Report and is intended for informational purposes only.
On June 22, 2018, we consummated a reverse triangular merger whereby Galaxy Next Generation,
Inc., a private company (co-founded by our now executives, Gary LeCroy (CEO) and Magen McGahee (CFO), merged with and into our newly formed
subsidiary, Galaxy MS, Inc. (Galaxy MS or Merger Sub), which was formed specifically for the transaction. Under the terms of the merger,
the private company shareholders transferred all their outstanding shares of common stock to Galaxy MS, in return for shares of our Series
C Preferred Stock. Prior to the merger, we operated under the name Full Circle Registry, Inc.'s (FLCR) and our operations were based upon
our ownership of Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a fourteen-theater movie complex located on approximately seven acres in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Prior to the merger, our sole business and source of revenue was from the operation of the theater, and as part of the merger agreement,
we had the right to spinout the theater to the prior shareholders of FLCR. Effective February 6, 2019, we sold our interest in the theater
to focus our resources on our technology operations.
On September 3, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of both Interlock
Concepts, Inc. (Concepts) and Ehlert Solutions Group, Inc. (Solutions) pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement that we entered
into with Concepts and Solutions. &#160;Under the stock purchase agreement, we acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of both
Concepts and Solutions. The purchase price for the acquisition was 1,350,000 shares of common stock and a two year note payable to the
seller in the principal amount of $3,000,000. The note payable to the seller is subject to adjustment based on the achievement of certain
future earnings goals and successful completion of certain pre-acquisition withholding tax issues of Concepts and Solutions.
Solutions and Concepts are Arizona-based audio design and manufacturing companies creating
innovative products that provide fundamental tools for building notification systems primarily to K-12 education market customers located
primarily in the north and northwest United States. These products and services allow institutions access to intercom, scheduling, and
notification systems with improved ease of use. The products provide an open architecture solution to customers which allows the products
to be used in both existing and new environments. Intercom, public announcement (PA), bell and control solutions are easily added and
integrated within the open architecture design and software model. These products combine elements over a common internet protocol (IP)
network, which minimizes infrastructure requirements and reduces costs by combining systems.
On October 15, 2020, we acquired the assets of Classroom Technologies Solutions, Inc. ("Classroom
Tech") for consideration of (a) paying off a secured Classroom Tech loan, not to exceed the greater of 50% of the value of the Classroom
Tech assets acquired or $120,000; (b) the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $44,526 to a Classroom Tech designee; and (c)
the issuance of 10 million shares of common stock to the seller of Classroom Tech. Classroom Tech provides cutting-edge presentation products
to schools, training facilities, churches, corporations and retail establishments. Their high-quality solutions are customized to meet
a variety of needs and budgets in order to provide the best in education and presentation technology. Classroom Tech direct-sources and
imports many devices and components which allows us to be innovative, nimble, and capable of delivering a broad range of cost-effective
solutions. Classroom Tech also offers in-house service and repair facilities and carries many top brands.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Industry Background and Trends" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Over the years, our products have evolved significantly from interactive whiteboards and other
analog type classroom technologies to high-definition displays and collaboration software. In the mid-2000s, schools began to adopt interactive
whiteboard type technology to assist in increasing student engagement and give teachers tools that were more amenable to the way our students
were learning. This evolution continues to move towards learning environments that are flexible, collaborative, and motivating for our
digital natives.
The educational technology market is currently experiencing substantial growth due to government
mandates for improving the education results in the United States. Education, governments, corporations, and individuals are recognizing
the growing need to utilize technology for more effective delivery of information to educate end users. Today, most classrooms are equipped
with some type of smart board technology but given the ever-changing nature of technology, previous investments are becoming obsolete.
The industry has several hundred technology resellers, selling a variety of products, already selling to these entities directly. Our
goal is to target the resellers to gain market share growth in the education technology market. With the global spread of the ongoing
novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, we have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and business. While our sales have not declined, and have increased as school systems have sought
to expand their ability to operate remotely during this pandemic, we have experienced supply chain delays.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="G2 Communicator Bell, Paging, and Intercom." parsing_type="i-tag;">Our newest addition to the G2 Communicator family of products is the G2 Visual Communicator.
This product offers an alerting system (often referred to as G2 Visual Alerts) which overtakes the screen of any enrolled device to send
instant communications anytime and from anywhere. Its integration with the bell, paging, and intercom products make it an easy upgrade
to be able to have the ADA (Americans with Disibilities Act of 1990) compliant component of a visual bell or page while also offering
a solution in emergency situations to make sure communication is being delivered throughout the building in an audible and visual way.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Classroom Audio Amplification Solutions." parsing_type="i-tag;"></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Raw Materials" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Materials used in the production of our manufactured items are sourced from around the world.
Examples of the materials we use in production include plastics, integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, power supplies, and other
raw materials. We source most of our materials from multiple sources but may still have a limited number of suppliers due to the proprietary
nature of the materials. Part unavailability, tariff changes, or defects in components could have an adverse impact on our business and
operations. Our sourcing partners and internal team works to implement strategies to mitigate these risks.
During late fiscal 2021, supply chain disruptions began to emerge because of the COVID-19
pandemic, including shipping container shortages and changes in global demand We were specifically impacted by the global shortage of
semiconductors and related electronic components, other materials needed for production, and freight availability. We have internally
adapted new ways of securing components and raw material to mitigate these issues and will continue to monitor the impact or potential
impact any supply shortages may have on our business.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Intellectual Property" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis.
Our policy is to protect our competitive position by filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements
that we consider important to the development of our business. This should allow us to pursue infringement claims against competitors
for protection due to patent violations. Although we own patents and possess rights under others to which we attach importance, we do
not believe that our business is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. We also own a number of trademarks that we believe
are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated good will with customers, but no part of our business
materially depends on such trademarks. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements with our employees and agents to protect our intellectual
property. Despite these intellectual property protections, there can be no assurance a competitor will not copy the functions or features
of our products.
As of June 1, 2021, we have 1US patent issued, 70701-1040, entitled "ASSISTIVE LISTENING SYSTEM
THAT USES SOUND WAVES FOR DEVICE PAIRING" and 3 pending US and foreign patents. Our US patent has terms until 1-22-2039

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Seasonality" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Our revenue has historically fluctuated due to the impact of purchasing cycles with school
budgets. School budgets follow a June 30 year end, and because of this, we see larger ordering towards the end of the school fiscal year
and the beginning of the school fiscal year when new budgets are allocated.
Because of the seasonality and volatility in business demand and variety of product types,
we may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may negatively affect our business
and operating results.
We have added additional revenue streams with our OEM customers in order to mitigate this
historic seasonality and hope to extend our offerings into other verticals outside of education in order to have a more constant sales
cycle moving forward.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Opportunities and plan of operations" parsing_type="b-tag;">We believe that our products, both hardware and software, and the products we intend to develop
as part of our extensive product road map, positions us to be one of the leading providers of interactive educational products and audio
amplification devices. We believe that the increase in consumer spending along with the ever-evolving increase in standards for curriculum
are two driving forces for the increase in the demand for interactive educational technology. Some additional factors that we believe
will impact our opportunity include:
&#9679;
Significant resources are being devoted to primary
        and secondary education, both in the United States andabroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic
        Advisers Report, United States education expenditure (primary, secondary and post-secondary) has been estimated at approximately $1.3
        trillion, with primary and secondary education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is approximated
        at roughly triple United States spending for primary and secondary education.
&#9679;
The United States primary
        and secondary market has always been a point of political debate and scrutiny. With American students ranking far behind other global
        students in international tests, the United States education system severely impairs the United States' economic, military, and diplomatic
        security as well as broader components of America's global leadership.
&#9679;
The United States education system has also seen major increases
        in budgets due to stimulus funds being distributed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools are encouraged to spend their CARES and ESSER
        monies on technology and products such as ours to assist them in overcoming the new challenges the pandemic has caused within our education
        system.
&#9679;
The demand for Interactive Flat Panels is on the rise. With traditional
        interactive whiteboards having been in the market for more than fifteen years, many of these technologies are coming to a refresh period
        and are being replaced with the newer, more advanced interactive flat panels.
&#9679;
The demand has also increased for our Communicator software, most
        relevantly our Visual Communicator software as emergency alerting continues to be a best practice to implement school safety procedures.
We intend to build upon our proven ability to produce and sell products.
We have begun to implement the growth strategies described below and expect to continue to do so in the upcoming years. In order to implement
each goal pertaining to growth, we may need additional capital to implement each strategy, particularly in relation to the target acquisition(s)
of complementary businesses or technologies.
We intend to grow our business by using the following methodology:
&#9679;
Capitalizing on market
        trends in the educational industry: We believe our long history of selling into the K-12 education market provides us with the expertise
        to continue to stay on the cutting edge of new product development and needs of the classroom teacher. We also believe our expertise in
        customer service and training positions us well for expected growth. We intend to build our core business by leveraging the strengths
        of our leadership and building out a solid team with experience and expertise in our market
&#9679;
Expanding our reseller
        channel sales: The educational technology industry is driven to a great extent by relationships. We intend to continue to grow and expand
        our resellers and integrators in strategic geographical regions so that we can leverage the relationships in the local school systems
        within those regions.
&#9679;
Growth through acquisitions:
        We believe that the interactive and collaborative classroom as well as school safety and security have many components and moving parts.
        We intend to stay on the cutting edge of new products by building out our product offerings and line card through strategic acquisitions.
        Acquisitions provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business by adding complementary products and new innovative technologies
        to provide a broader G2 experience to our customers. We intend to pursue acquisitions that provide services within our current core product
        offerings, extend our geographic reach, and expand our product offerings.
&#9679;
Further developing intellectual
        property: We intend to build upon our success in developing original software that we own and license to other brands, and distributors
        globally. When we develop an original software or application, we retain the copyright and patent of that content. We expect to create
        additional revenue streams from development fees, brand license fees, distribution license fees and ancillary sources.
&#9679;
Expanding
        our geographic presence: We believe that by expanding our physical presence into select domestic and international regions, we will be
        better able to attract and retain clients. With a physical presence in strategic locations around the US, we believe we can provide better
        customer service and offer local services and training resulting in an increase in revenue for those areas.
<company_defined_section title="-6-" parsing_type="emphasis;"></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Logistics and suppliers" parsing_type="b-tag;">Logistics are currently provided by our Toccoa, Georgia, Broomfield, Colorado, Jacksonville,
Florida and Peoria, Arizona facilities and multiple import and freight carriers throughout the US. These partners allow us to provide
affordable freight routes and shorter delivery times to our customers. Our suppliers for ODM and OEM are located in the USA, China, and
Taiwan.
<company_defined_section title="Competition" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">We encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product and geographic area. Our competitors
include both United States and foreign companies and range in size and product offerings. Our competitors may develop lower-cost or lower-featured
products and may be willing to charge lower prices to increase their market share. Some competitors have more capital, supply chain access,
and other resources which may allow them to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements.
The interactive education industry is highly competitive and has frequent product introductions
and quick technological advances. With less barriers on the school technology entry, we face heated competition from other interactive
panel developers, manufacturers, and distributors. We compete with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive panels
and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens, smart phones, such as Smart Technologies, Promethean, Samsung, Panasonic
and ClearTouch.
We believe that our ability to compete depends upon customer centric product quality and features,
technical expertise, and cost-effective solutions.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Research and Development" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">We believe our experience in engineering, process design, product design and development capabilities,
and the investments made in our team to date, such as hiring third party developers, designers and coders are very important factors in
being able to continue to develop, produce, and offer the most up-to-date technology desired by our market.
Over the past four years, we have invested in our team third party developers, designers and
coders and our development to increase our differentiated product platforms, advance our software architecture and offerings, support
customer requirements, and advance our competitive landscape.
Product design and development investments in the near term are focused on developing or improving
our audio technology and our school safety technology. The new technologies are focused on improving communication in schools during crisis
events to ensure safety protocols are accessible and easy to manage by school employees.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Human Resources/Employees" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Our core values support our commitment to our employees. We believe that our success depends
upon our ability to attract, develop, retain, and motivate key personnel. We seek to recruit, retain, and develop our existing and future
workforce for decade-long engagements to build long-term mutual prosperity. We encourage each employee to proactively and continuously
build self-awareness and openness to others' experiences and perspectives. We also provide competitive salaries and opportunities for
bonuses in order to attract and retain employees.
The safety and well-being of our team members is a top priority and we believe every team
member plays an essential role in creating a safe and healthy workplace. We provide our employees and their families with access to a
variety of health programs. In response to COVID-19, we implemented changes that we consider to be in the best interest of our employees.
We implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work and allowed for employees to work from home when
able. We believe we have been able to preserve our business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees safe
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately twenty-four full time employees, of whom four are
executives, six employees are engaged in product development, engineering and research and development, eight employees are engaged in
sales and marketing, four employees are engaged in administrative and clerical services and two employees are engaged in service and training.
In addition, approximately two individuals provide consulting services as independent contractors.
None of our employees are represented by labor organizations. We consider our relationship
with our employees to be excellent.

</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></item><item title="ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS." parsing_type="item;">The factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth
in this Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition.
<company_defined_section title="Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic" parsing_type="emphasis;">Pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity,
financial condition, and financial results.
A serious global pandemic, including the current COVID-19 pandemic and variants of COVID-19,
can adversely impact, shock and weaken the global economy. These impacts can amplify other risk factors and could have a material impact
on our operations, liquidity, financial conditions, and financial results.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19
pandemic-related risks that may impact our business include increased exposure to: global regulatory, geopolitical, and societal changes;
rapid degradation of global economic conditions, creating an increase in the volatility and the timing and level of orders; supply chain
disruptions, material shortages, and increases in the costs of components; changes in labor force availability, which could reduce our
ability to operate across our business in development, sales and marketing, production, installation, and ongoing service and support;
an increased risk of being subject to contract performance claims if we are unable to deliver according to the terms of our contracts
or commitments and cannot claim force majeure to mitigate or eliminate our exposure to such claims; increased geographic work restrictions
that could impact our ability to market, sell, manufacture and/or install our products; an increase in our exposure to claims or litigation
relating to the pandemic; limitations on our ability to meet the terms of our bank credit agreements that cause restrictions on our ability
to access the liquidity under such agreements; reduced access to and an increase in the cost of capital; reduced access to surety bonds
or bank guarantees to secure customer orders; volatility and changes in foreign currency rates; delayed timing of collections and/or decreased
collectability of receivables and contract assets; and a material reduction to the values of our assets including, but not limited to,
inventory, deferred tax assets, goodwill, intangibles, and property and equipment.
To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had, but may in the future have, an unfavorable impact
on certain areas of our business. The broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of
operations remain uncertain and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the
availability, distribution, and effectiveness of vaccines to address the COVID-19 virus; and any change in trends on how people gather.
The impact on our customers and suppliers and the range of governmental and community reactions to the pandemic are uncertain. To the
extent that our customers and suppliers are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, this could reduce the availability, or result
in delays in the delivery, of materials or supplies, or delays in customer payments and orders, which in turn could materially interrupt
our business operations and/or impact our liquidity. Site closures or project delays have occurred and have required increased social
distancing and health-related precautions in our manufacturing facilities and many work sites, which may cause additional project delays
and additional costs to be incurred. COVID-19 could disrupt our operations due to absenteeism by infected or ill employees or other employees
who elect not to come to work due to the illness or due to quarantines.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements" parsing_type="emphasis;"><company_defined_section title="We have incurred losses for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 and there can be no assurance that we will generate net income" parsing_type="i-tag;">For the year ended June 30, 2021, we had a net loss of $24,434,336. For the year ended June
30, 2020, we had a net loss of $14,026,107. There can be no assurance that our losses will not continue in the future, even if our revenues
and expenditures for the products and solutions we sell and distribute increase. In addition, as of June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated
stockholders' deficit of approximately $1,400,000 and cash used in operations of approximately $6,300,000. These factors raise substantial
doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern" parsing_type="i-tag;"></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="." parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">Our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency raises substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and contemplate the realization of assets and the settlement of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm for the
years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern. If we cannot generate the required revenues and gross margin to achieve profitability or obtain additional capital on acceptable
terms, we will need to substantially revise our business plan or cease operations and an investor could suffer the loss of a significant
portion or all of his investment in our Company.

<company_defined_section title="We require funds to operate and expand our business" parsing_type="i-tag;"></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="." parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">During the year ended June 30, 2021, our operating activities used net cash of approximately
$6.3 million and as of June 30, 2021 our cash and cash equivalents were $541,591. As of June 30, 2021, our accumulated stockholders' deficit
totaled approximately $1.4 million on a consolidated basis. Although we have been able to mitigate our losses during the fourth quarter
of the year ended June 30, 2021, we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses
to increase. We will require funds to purchase additional inventories, pay our vendors, and build our marketing and sales staff. If we
do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to expand our business and could default on our obligations.
There can be no assurance that such financing will be available and that the equity interests of all of our stockholders would not be
substantially diluted. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity or debt securities, which will
have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders
may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to
conduct our business. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the rules of the SEC and the terms
of the agreements that we enter into. &#160;We currently do not have any committed sources of financing other than our line of credit,
the Amended and Restated &#160;Equity Purchase Agreement that we entered into with Tysadco Partners LLC on December 29, 2020, and accounts
receivable factoring agreement, each of which requires us to meet certain conditions to utilize and there can be no assurance that we
will meet those conditions.
<company_defined_section title="We have disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting procedures which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis." parsing_type="i-tag;">In connection with our assessment of internal control over financial reporting under Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to
our disclosure controls and procedures. The material weakness relates to the fact that our management is relying on external consultants
for purposes of preparing its financial reporting package; however, the officers may not be able to identify errors and irregularities
in the financial reporting package before its release as a continuous disclosure document. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the deficiencies, we
have discovered it is reasonably possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not have prevented or detected errors from
occurring that could have been material, either individually or in the aggregate.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We have outstanding debt secured by a security interest in all our assets and our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of such debt could result in our loss of all of our assets." parsing_type="i-tag;">We have outstanding debt secured by a security interest in all our assets. The debt contains
both affirmative and negative covenants. Our obligations under the debt may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default
in accordance with the terms of the debt, which includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, the inaccuracy of representations
or warranties, cross-defaults related to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to certain
other matters. If we fail to comply with these covenants or if we fail to make certain payments under the secured loans when due, the
creditors could declare the debt in default. If we default on the debt, the creditors have the right to seize our assets that secure the
debt, which may force us to suspend all operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our failure to fulfill all our registration requirements in connection with our issued debentures may cause us to suffer liquidated damages, which may be very costly." parsing_type="i-tag;">Pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement that we entered into in connection
with the debentures, we were required to file a registration statement with respect to securities underlying the debentures within a certain
time period, have the registration statement declared effective within a certain time period and maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement. The failure to do so could result in the payment of liquidated damages by us, which could be significant. Although the registration
statement has been declared effective, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the effectiveness of any registration
statement, and therefore there can be no assurance that we will not incur damages with respect to such agreements.
Risks Related to our Business
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures, or other growth opportunities, which could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs and could dilute our stockholders. We may also face competition in our acquisition strategy, and such competition may limit our number of proposed acquisitions, joint ventures, and other growth opportunities." parsing_type="i-tag;">We recently acquired all of the equity of Interlock Concepts, Inc. and Ehlert Solutions Group,
Inc. and the assets of Classroom Technology Solutions, Inc. and have explored a wide range of proposed acquisitions, joint ventures and
other growth ventures with other educational technology companies that have interests in related businesses or other strategic opportunities.
The process of integrating any acquired business, including Interlock Concepts, Inc. and Ehlert Solutions Group, Inc. and Classroom Technology
Solutions, Inc., may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky. Any future acquisitions, joint ventures
or other growth opportunities will be subject to a number of challenges.
&#9679;
diversion of management time and resources as well as a shift of focus from operating the
        businesses to issues related to integration and administration, which could result in the potential disruption of our ongoing business;
&#9679;
the need to integrate each company&#146;s accounting, management,
        information, human resources, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration
        is delayed or not implemented;
&#9679;
the need to implement controls, procedures, and policies appropriate
        for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures, and policies;
&#9679;
difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures,
        and policies;
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="-9-" parsing_type="emphasis;">&#9679;
difficulties in managing operations in widely disparate time zones;
&#9679;
potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses,
        including liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including violations of laws, rules and regulations,
        commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;
&#9679;
difficulty retaining key alliances on attractive terms with partners
        and suppliers;
&#9679;
declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes
        in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction or culture of the business;
&#9679;
in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations
        across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with
        specific countries; and
&#9679;
in some cases, the need to transition operations, end-users, and
        customers onto our existing platforms.
Failure to manage expansion effectively may affect our success in executing our business plan
and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of any
or all of our acquisitions or may not realize them in the time frame expected. Future acquisitions or mergers may require us to issue
additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write-offs of goodwill,
any of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
<company_defined_section title="We may have difficulty in entering and maintaining strategic alliances with third parties." parsing_type="i-tag;">We have entered into and we may continue to enter into strategic alliances with third parties
to gain access to new and innovative technologies and markets. These parties are often large, established companies. Negotiating and performing
under these arrangements involves significant time and expense, and we may not have sufficient resources to devote to our strategic alliances,
particularly those with companies that have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. The anticipated benefits of
these arrangements may never materialize and performing under these arrangements may adversely affect our results of operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and adversely affect our working capital and liquidity throughout the year." parsing_type="i-tag;">We expect quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results to continue. These
fluctuations could result in volatility and adversely affect our cash flow, working capital and liquidity. As our business grows, we expect
these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced. Traditionally, the bulk of expenditures by school districts occur in the second
and third calendar quarters after receipt of budget allocations. Because our revenues and operating results are driven largely by the
purchasing cycles of the educational market and normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business sequential quarterly
comparisons of our financial results may not provide an accurate assessment of our financial position.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our working capital requirements and cash flows are subject to fluctuation, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition." parsing_type="i-tag;">If we are unable to manage fluctuations in cash flow, our business, operating results, and
financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Our working capital requirements and cash flows have historically been, and
are expected to continue to be, subject to seasonal fluctuations, depending on several factors. Factors which could result in fluctuations
in our working capital and cash flows include:
&#9679;
the quantity of product and service sales revenue achieved;
&#9679;
the margins achieved on sales of products and services;
&#9679;
the timing and collection of receivables;
&#9679;
the timing and size of inventory and related component purchases;
        and
&#9679;
the timing of payment on payables and accrued liabilities.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We operate in a highly competitive industry." parsing_type="i-tag;">The interactive learning technology industry in which we operate is highly competitive and
characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and
use of interactive projectors, interactive whiteboards, and microcomputer-based logging technologies and combinations of them. We face
substantial competition from developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive learning products and solutions, including interactive
projectors, interactive whiteboards, and microcomputer data logging products.
Many of these competitors have, and our potential competitors may have, significantly greater
financial and other resources than we do and have spent, and may continue to spend, significant amounts of resources to try to enter or
expand their presence in the market. These companies may manufacture and/or distribute new, disruptive or substitute products that compete
for the pool of available funds that previously could have been spent on interactive displays and associated products. In addition, low
cost competitors have appeared in China and other countries. We may not be able to compete effectively against these current and future
competitors. Increased competition or other competitive pressures have and may continue to result in price reductions, reduced margins,
or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
-10-
Some of our customers are required to purchase equipment by soliciting proposals from a number
of sources and, in some cases, are required to purchase from the lowest bidder. While we attempt to price our products competitively based
upon the relative features they offer, our competitors' prices and other factors, we are often not the lowest bidder and, in such cases,
may lose sales. For example, we have observed sales of tablet computers by competitors to school districts in the U.S. whose technology
budgets could otherwise have been used to purchase interactive displays.
Competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements more effectively and faster than we can or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products than
we can. Current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, including through
mergers or acquisitions, to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of customers. If these interactive display competitors
or other substitute or alternative technology competitors acquire significantly increased market share, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="If we are unable to continually enhance our products and to develop, introduce and sell new technologies and products at competitive prices and in a timely manner, our business will be harmed." parsing_type="i-tag;">Our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our products and to develop, introduce
and sell new technologies and products offering enhanced performance and functionality at competitive prices and in a timely manner and
market acceptance of any new products. If we are unable, for any reason, to enhance, develop, introduce, and sell new products in a timely
manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements or otherwise, our business will be harmed.
The development of new technologies and products involves time, substantial costs, and risks.
Our ability to successfully develop new technologies will depend in large measure on our ability to maintain a technically skilled research
and development staff and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry. The success of new product introductions depends
on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the effective management of purchase commitments
and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of components in appropriate quantities and costs to meet
anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality or other defects and our ability to manage distribution and production
issues related to new product introductions. If we are unsuccessful in selling the new products that we develop and introduce, or any
future products that we may develop, we may carry obsolete inventory and have reduced available working capital for the development of
other new technologies and products.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We rely on highly skilled personnel, and, if we are unable to attract, retain or motivate qualified personnel, we may not be able to operate our business effectively." parsing_type="i-tag;">If any of our employees leaves us, and we fail to effectively manage a transition to new personnel,
or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and experienced professionals on acceptable terms, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected. Our success depends in large part on continued employment of senior management and
key personnel who can effectively operate our business, as well as our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Competition for
highly skilled management, technical, research and development and other employees is intense in the high-technology industry and we may
not be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel in the future. In making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology
industry, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment.
Inasmuch as our products are installed in many states throughout the United States, our employment
needs include the hiring of skilled installers in several states and we are subject to the employment laws of many states. Our long-term
incentive programs may not be attractive enough or perform sufficiently to attract or retain qualified personnel.
Our success also depends on our having highly trained financial, technical, recruiting, sales
and marketing personnel. We will need to continue to hire additional personnel as our business grows. A shortage in the number of people
with these skills or our failure to attract them to our company could impede our ability to increase revenues from our existing products
and services, ensure full compliance with federal and state regulations, or launch new product offerings and would have an adverse effect
on our business and financial results.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our businesses are geographically concentrated and could be significantly affected by any adverse change in the regions in which we operate." parsing_type="i-tag;">Historically, our business operations have been located primarily throughout the Southeast
region of the United States. While we expand our business to new geographic areas, we are still highly concentrated in the United States.
Because we derived all of our total revenues on a consolidated basis for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 from our operations in
the United States, our business is exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes, economic downturns and changes in political
conditions in the United States. If we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks, our businesses, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We are dependent upon our key suppliers for the components used in our products. Our suppliers may not be able to always supply components or products to us on a timely basis and on favorable terms, and as a result, our dependency on third party suppliers has adversely affected our revenue and may continue to do so." parsing_type="i-tag;">We are subject to disruptions in our operations if our sole or limited supply contract manufacturers
decrease or stop production of components and products, or if such suppliers and contract manufacturers do not produce components and
products of sufficient quantity. We do not manufacture any of the raw materials for the products we sell and distribute and are dependent
upon a limited number of suppliers for all products and components. We depend on obtaining adequate supplies of quality components on
a timely basis with favorable terms, and some of those components, as well as certain complete products that we sell are provided to us
by only one supplier or contract manufacturer. Alternative sources for our components are not always available. Approximately 60% of our
products and components are manufactured overseas, so they have long lead times, and events such as local disruptions, natural disasters
or political conflict may cause unexpected interruptions to the supply of our products or components.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We are currently subject to market prices for the components that we purchase, which are subject to fluctuation beyond our control. An increase in the price of components used in our products could result in an increase in costs to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and demand for our products." parsing_type="i-tag;">Interruptions in our ability to procure needed components for our systems, whether due to
discontinuance by our suppliers, delays or failures in delivery, shortages caused by inadequate production capacity, the COVID-19 pandemic
or unavailability, financial failure, manufacturing quality, or for other reasons, would adversely affect or limit our sales and growth.
There is no assurance that we will continue to find qualified manufacturers on acceptable terms and, if we do, there can be no assurance
that product quality will continue to be acceptable, which could lead to a loss of sales and revenues.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our business is subject to the risks associated with doing business in China" parsing_type="i-tag;"></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="." parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">As a result of our reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers located in China, our
results of operations, financial condition, and prospects are subject to a significant degree to economic, political, and legal developments
in China including government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. China's economy
differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement,
level of development, growth rate and control of foreign exchange, and allocation of resources. Since we rely on a third-party manufacturer
located in China for certain of our parts, our business is subject to the risks associated with doing business in China, including:
&#9679;
adverse political
        and economic conditions, particularly those potentially negatively affecting the trade relationship between the United States and China;
&#9679;
trade protection measures, such as tariff increases, and import and export licensing and control requirements;
&#9679;
potentially negative
        consequences from changes in tax laws;
&#9679;
difficulties
        associated with the Chinese legal system, including increased costs and uncertainties associated with enforcing contractual obligations
        in China;
&#9679;
historically
        lower protection of intellectual property rights;
&#9679;
changes and volatility
        in currency exchange rates;
&#9679;
unexpected or unfavorable
        changes in regulatory requirements; and
&#9679;
difficulties
        in managing foreign relationships and operations generally.
These risks are likely to be exacerbated by our limited experience with our current products
and manufacturing processes. If demand for our products materializes, we may have to invest additional resources to purchase materials,
hire and train employees, and enhance our manufacturing processes. It may not be possible for us to manufacture our product at a cost
or in quantities sufficient to make our product commercially viable. Any of these factors may affect our ability to manufacture our products
and could reduce gross margins and profitability.
<company_defined_section title="We rely on third party manufacturers and if they do not perform in a satisfactory manner, it may harm our business" parsing_type="i-tag;">Reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers entails risks to which we would not be
subject if we manufactured the components for our products ourselves, including:
&#9679;
reliance on the
        third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;
&#9679;
the
        possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control or the insolvency of any of
        these third parties or other financial difficulties, labor unrest, natural disasters or other factors adversely affecting their ability
        to conduct their business; and
&#9679;
possibility of
        termination or non-renewal of the agreements by the third parties, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us, because of our breach
        of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="-12-" parsing_type="emphasis;">If our contract manufacturer or its suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities
of our components required for our products on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or
more replacement manufacturers or suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes
and quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products, and we would lose potential revenue. It
may also take a significant period of time to establish an alternative source of supply for our components.
<company_defined_section title="In the past, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on products manufactured in China and imported into the United States causing the prices for such products to increase. This could cause customer demand for our products to decrease." parsing_type="i-tag;">Although the components of our products that are manufactured in China are currently exempt
from the tariffs on products manufactured in China, if the exemption were to no longer be available to such products, the imposition of
tariffs on our products would most likely cause prices to rise, which would generally increase the price for our products, potentially
impact our gross margins, all of which may cause a reduction in demand.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our facilities and information systems and those of our key suppliers could be damaged as a result of disasters or unpredictable events, which could have an adverse effect on our business operations." parsing_type="i-tag;">Our logistics are currently provided by our Toccoa, Georgia, our Broomfield, Colorado, our
Peoria, Arizona and our Jacksonville, Florida facilities and multiple import and freight carriers throughout the United States. Our suppliers
for original design manufacturing ("ODM") and original equipment manufacturing ("OEM") are located in the United States, China, and Taiwan.
If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, transportation disasters or other events
occur in any of these locations, or our information systems or communications network or those of any of our key component suppliers breaks
down or operates improperly as a result of such events, our facilities or those of our key suppliers may be seriously damaged, and we
may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may also incur expenses relating to such damages. If production
or shipment of our products or components is stopped or delayed or if we incur any increased expenses as a result of damage to our facilities,
our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Increases in component costs, long lead times, supply shortages, and supply changes could disrupt our supply chain and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results." parsing_type="i-tag;">Meeting customer demand partially depends on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery
of components for our products. As demand for our products increases, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced temporary
supply chain delays also related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the components that go into the manufacturing of our products are sourced
from a limited number of third-party suppliers. Our manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf, subject to certain
approved supplier lists, and we do not have long-term arrangements with most of our component suppliers. We are therefore subject to the
risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components
used in our products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in design,
quantities, and delivery schedules. We may in the future experience component shortages, and the predictability of the availability of
these components may be limited. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from suppliers of these components, we may
not be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner. Developing alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming,
difficult, and costly and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may undermine
our ability to fill our orders in a timely manner. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the
inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would
harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers.
Moreover, volatile economic conditions may make it more likely that our suppliers may be unable
to timely deliver supplies, or at all, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to timely locate alternative suppliers of comparable
quality at an acceptable price. The loss of a significant supplier, an increase in component costs, or delays or disruptions in the delivery
of components, could adversely impact our ability to generate future revenue and earnings and have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and operating results.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Risks Related to our Industry and Regulations" parsing_type="b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="Decreases in, or stagnation of, spending or changes in the spending policies or budget priorities for government funding of schools, colleges, universities, other education providers or government agencies may have a material adverse effect on our revenue." parsing_type="i-tag;">Any decrease in, stagnation of or adverse change in national, federal, state, provincial or
local funding for primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, or other education providers or other industries that use our
products could cause our current and prospective customers to reduce their purchases of our products, which could cause us to lose revenue.
Our customers include primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities, other education providers which depend heavily on government
funding. Many federal, state, and local governments have limited fiscal capacity and have experienced recent declines in tax revenues.
Many of those governments have reacted to the decreases in tax revenues and could continue to react to the decreases in tax revenues by
cutting funding to educational institutions. If our products are not a high priority expenditure for such institutions, or if such institutions
allocate expenditures to substitute or alternative technologies, we could lose revenue. In addition, a specific reduction in governmental
funding support for products such as ours could also cause us to lose revenue.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="If our products fail to comply with consumer product or environmental laws, it could materially affect our financial performance." parsing_type="i-tag;">If our products do not meet applicable safety or regulatory standards, we could experience
lost sales, diverted resources and increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
of operations. Our products are subject to environmental regulations in some jurisdictions in which we will do business, we are and will
be required to comply with a variety of product safety, product testing and environmental regulations, including compliance with applicable
laws and standards with respect to lead content and other child safety and environmental issues. Events that give rise to actual, potential
or perceived product safety or environmental concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result
in product recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative consumer perceptions regarding the safety of our products could cause
negative publicity and harm our reputation.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="We have limited protection for our intellectual property, which could impact our competitive position." parsing_type="b-tag;i-tag;">We intend to rely on a combination of common law copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret
laws and measures to protect our proprietary information. We have obtained patent protection for certain of our products; however, such
protection does not prevent unauthorized use of such technology. Trademark and copyright protections may be limited, and enforcement could
be too costly to be effective. It may also be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of, or otherwise obtain and use,
our proprietary information without authorization, including, but not limited to, product design, software, customer and prospective customer
lists, trade secrets, copyrights, patents and other proprietary rights and materials. Other parties can use and register confusingly similar
business, product, and service names, as well as domain names, which could divert customers, resulting in a material adverse effect on
our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries,
which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting
and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing
countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating
to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products
in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled
to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government
contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the relevant
patent rights. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our
business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be
adversely affected.
If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position
could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or future patents
we may obtain. In addition, our licensed patents may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. We may be required to spend
significant resources to monitor and police our licensed intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our
competitive position may be harmed. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs
and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted
narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail
in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition,
competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
<company_defined_section title="We may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights necessary to protect our proprietary technology and business." parsing_type="i-tag;">Our commercial success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop new or
improved technologies and products, and to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights or statutory protection for these technologies
and products in the United States and other countries. We will seek to patent concepts, components, processes, designs and methods, and
other inventions and technologies that we consider have commercial value or that will likely give us a technological advantage. Despite
devoting resources to the research and development of proprietary technology, we may not be able to develop technology that is patentable
or protectable. Patents may not be issued in connection with pending patent applications, and claims allowed may not be sufficient to
allow us or our customers to use the inventions that created exclusively. Furthermore, any patents issued could be challenged, re-examined,
held invalid or unenforceable or circumvented and may not provide sufficient protection or a competitive advantage. In addition, despite
efforts to protect and maintain patents, competitors and other third parties may be able to design around our patents or develop products
similar to our products that are not within the scope of our patents.
Finally, patents provide certain statutory protection only for a limited period of time that
varies depending on the jurisdiction and type of patent. The statutory protection term of certain patents may expire and, thereafter,
the underlying technology of such patents can be used by any third-party including competitors.
Prosecution and protection of the rights sought in patent applications and patents can be
costly and uncertain, often involve complex legal and factual issues and consume significant time and resources. In addition, the breadth
of claims allowed in our patents, their enforceability, and our ability to protect and maintain them cannot be predicted with any certainty.
The laws of certain countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Even if
our patents are held to be valid and enforceable in a certain jurisdiction, any legal proceedings that we may initiate against third parties
to enforce such patents will likely be expensive, take significant time and divert management's attention from other business matters.
We cannot assure that any of the issued patents or pending patent applications will provide any protectable, maintainable, or enforceable
rights or competitive advantages to us.
-14-
In addition to patents, we will rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets
and other related laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect, maintain and enforce our proprietary technology
and intellectual property rights. However, our ability to protect our brands by registering certain trademarks may be limited. In addition,
while we will generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, contract manufacturers,
distributors, and resellers and with others to attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary and confidential information,
it is possible that:
&#9679;
misappropriation of our proprietary and confidential information, including technology, will
        nevertheless occur;
&#9679;
our confidentiality agreements will not be honored or may be rendered
        unenforceable;
&#9679;
third parties will independently develop equivalent, superior, or
        competitive technology or products;
&#9679;
disputes will arise with our current or future strategic licensees,
        customers or others concerning the ownership, validity, enforceability, use, patentability or registrability of intellectual property;
        or
&#9679;
unauthorized disclosure of our know-how, trade
        secrets or other proprietary or confidential information will occur.
We cannot assure that we will be successful in protecting, maintaining
or enforcing our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in protecting, maintaining, or enforcing our intellectual property
rights, then our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, which could:
&#9679;
adversely affect our relationships with current or future distributors
        and resellers of our products;
&#9679;
adversely affect our reputation with customers;
&#9679;
be time-consuming and expensive to evaluate and defend;
&#9679;
cause product shipment delays or stoppages;
&#9679;
divert management&#146;s attention and resources;
&#9679;
subject us to significant liabilities and damages;
&#9679;
require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements; or
&#9679;
require us to cease certain activities, including
        the sale of products.
If it is determined that we have infringed, violated or are infringing or violating a patent
or other intellectual property right of any other person or if we are found liable in respect of any other related claim, then, in addition
to being liable for potentially substantial damages, we may be prohibited from developing, using, distributing, selling or commercializing
certain of our technologies and products unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property right.
We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain any such license on a timely basis or on commercially favorable terms, or that any such
licenses will be available, or that workarounds will be feasible and cost-efficient. If we do not obtain such a license or find a cost-efficient
workaround, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we could be required to
cease related business operations in some markets and restructure our business to focus on our continuing operations in other markets.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology or another aspect of our business infringes the intellectual property of others." parsing_type="i-tag;">The markets in which we will compete are characterized by the existence of a large number
of patents and trade secrets and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making
claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like ours. Also, third parties may make infringement claims against us that
relate to technology developed and owned by one of our suppliers for which our suppliers may or may not indemnify us. Even if we are indemnified
against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations and determining the extent such of such
obligations could require additional litigation. Claims of intellectual property infringement against us or our suppliers might require
us to redesign our products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent
injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our products or services. If we cannot or do not license the infringed intellectual
property on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar intellectual property from another source, our revenue and operating results
could be adversely impacted. Additionally, our customers and distributors may not purchase our offerings if they are concerned that they
may infringe third party intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly
to defend in litigation, divert management's attention and resources, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur significant expenses.
The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop attractive products, we might not be able to maintain or increase our revenue or achieve profitability" parsing_type="i-tag;">If we are unable to introduce new products or technologies in a timely manner or our new products
or technologies are not accepted by our customers, our competitors may introduce more attractive products which would adversely impact
our competitive position. Failure to respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower
revenues and excess inventory positions of outdated products. Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends
as well as to anticipate and react to change demands and preferences of customers in a timely manner.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We may be unable to keep pace with changes in technology as our business and market strategy evolves." parsing_type="i-tag;">There can be no assurance that we will be able to respond successfully to technological change.
We will need to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to remain
competitive. The need to respond to technological changes may require us to make substantial, unanticipated expenditures.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="The loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business." parsing_type="i-tag;">Our business is significantly dependent upon Gary LeCroy and Magen McGahee, who are primarily
responsible for our day-to-day operations and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers,
to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels, and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management
team. We cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers. The loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive
officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our Chief Executive Officer and Director and our Chief Financial Officer and Director will have significant influence over us." parsing_type="i-tag;">Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer/Chief Operating Officer
initially were issued 85% of our outstanding voting stock. &#160;The employment agreements that we entered into with each of them
in January 2020, as amended, provides that we will issue to them preferred stock such that they together maintain 51% of our outstanding
voting securities. &#160;Upon issuance of such preferred stock, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
will
have the ability to control our business affairs.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Risks Related to Our Common Stock" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our share price, and any additional
capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities may dilute your ownership in us and may adversely affect
the market price of our common stock.
We intend, from time to time, to seek additional equity or debt financing to finance working
capital requirements, continue our expansion, develop new products, or make acquisitions or other investments. In addition, we have issued
convertible securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock. In addition, if our business plans change, general economic,
financial or political conditions in our industry change, or other circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow, the
anticipated cash needs of our business, as well as our conclusions as to the adequacy of our available sources of capital, could change
significantly. Any of these events or circumstances could result in significant additional funding needs, requiring us to raise additional
capital. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity shares, preferred shares or debt securities, the terms of such
securities could impose restrictions on our operations and would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. If financing
is not available on satisfactory terms, or at all, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired
and our results of operations may suffer.
<company_defined_section title="The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to fluctuate and possibly decline significantly." parsing_type="i-tag;">The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations.
Our financial performance, government regulatory action, tax laws and market conditions in general could have a significant impact on
the future market price of our common stock. Investors may not be able to resell your shares at or above the current price due to a number
of factors such as those listed under this "Risk Factors" section. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or
result in fluctuations in the price of our stock include:
&#9679;
our operating and financial performance and prospects;
&#9679;
our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in
        our industry;
&#9679;
the public&#146;s reaction to our press releases, our other public
        announcements and our filings with the SEC;
&#9679;
the failure of analysts to cover our common stock;
&#9679;
strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions
        or restructurings;
&#9679;
announcements by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant
        contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;
&#9679;
new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws
        or regulations applicable to our business;
&#9679;
changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations
        or principles;
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="-16-" parsing_type="emphasis;">&#9679;
announcements by third parties or governmental entities of significant
        claims or proceedings against us;
&#9679;
new laws and governmental regulations, or other regulatory developments,
        applicable to our industry;
&#9679;
changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies
        or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;
&#9679;
changes in government spending levels on education;
&#9679;
changes in key personnel;
&#9679;
sales of common stock by us, members of our management team or
        our stockholders;
&#9679;
the granting or exercise of employee stock
        options or other equity awards;
&#9679;
the volume of trading in our common stock; and
&#9679;
the realization of any risks described in
        this section under the caption &#147;Risk Factors.&#148;
Furthermore, the stock market has recently experienced volatility that, in some cases, has
been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations
may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities
class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention
of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.
<company_defined_section title="Certain Provisions of Nevada law may have anti-takeover effects." parsing_type="i-tag;">Certain provisions of Nevada law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult
a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our Company, including Sections 78.411 through 78.444 of the Nevada Revised Statutes,
which prohibit a Nevada corporation from engaging in any business combination with any "interested stockholder" (as defined in the statute)
for a period of two years unless certain conditions are met. In addition, our senior management is entitled to certain payments upon a
change in control and certain of the restricted shares we have granted provide for the acceleration of vesting in the event of a change
in control of our Company.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We have no intention of declaring dividends in the foreseeable future." parsing_type="i-tag;">The decision to pay cash dividends on our common stock rests with our board of directors and
will depend on our earnings, unencumbered cash, capital requirements and financial condition. We do not anticipate declaring any dividends
in the foreseeable future, as we intend to use any excess cash to fund our operations. Investors in our common stock should not expect
to receive dividend income on their investment, and investors will be dependent on the appreciation of our common stock to earn a return
on their investment.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="The exercise or conversion of currently outstanding debt or preferred stock would further dilute holders of our common stock." parsing_type="i-tag;">We currently have outstanding debt that convert into shares of our common and preferred stock,
and preferred stock that converts into shares of our common stock. Our Series D Preferred Stock converts into twenty percent of the number
of shares that are outstanding on the date of conversion and our Series E Preferred Stock converts into 1,190,476 shares of our common
stock. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue shares of common and preferred stock.
We may issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock to complete a business combination or to raise capital. Such stock issuances
could be made at a price that reflects a discount from the then-current trading price of our common stock. These conversions and issuances
would dilute our stockholders' ownership interest, which among other things would have the effect of reducing their influence on matters
on which our stockholders vote. In addition, our stockholders and prospective investors may incur additional dilution if holders of stock
options and warrants, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options or warrants to purchase shares of
our common stock or if our convertible debt holders convert their debt.

</item><item title="ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." parsing_type="item;">The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
<company_defined_section title="Overview" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">Since we completed a reverse triangular merger in June 2018, we have been a manufacturer and
U.S. distributor of interactive learning technology hardware and software that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully
collaborative instructional environment. Galaxy's products include Galaxy's own private-label interactive touch screen panel, its own
intercom, bell, and paging solutions, as well as an audio amplification line of products that is currently supported by OEM relationships.
We provide a multitude of services to our customers, including installation, training, and maintenance. &#160;In September 2019, we acquired
Interlock Concepts, Inc. (Concepts) and Ehlert Solutions Group, Inc. (Solutions). In October 2020, we acquired the assets of Classroom
Technology Solutions, Inc.
This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(MD&amp;A) includes a discussion of our operations for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. The discussion of our operations for the
year ended June 30, 2020 includes the results of operations of Concepts and Solutions for part of the fiscal year as Concepts and Solutions
were acquired in September 2019 and does not include the operations of Classroom Technology Solutions since its assets were acquired the
following fiscal year. The discussion of the operations for the year ended June 30, 2021 includes the operations of Concepts and Solutions
for the full year since they were acquired in September 2019 and the operations of Classroom Technology Solutions for a portion of the
year since it was acquired in October 2020. Accordingly, the results of operations reported for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020
and are not comparable.
With the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic since the first
quarter of 2020, we have implemented business continuity plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
our employees and business. &#160;While our revenue has not been negatively impacted at this time and demand for our products has increased,
given the global economic slowdown, and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic, we have experienced supply chain
issues resulting from the pandemic which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, &#160;the business of our suppliers and other commercial partners, our corporate
development objectives and the value of and market for our common stock, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain
and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines,
social distancing and business closure requirements in the United States and other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally
to contain and treat the disease. &#160;The global economic slowdown and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, to
the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening
many of the other risks and uncertainties which we face.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Management's Discussion and Analysis discusses our consolidated financial statements which
have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and
on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
<company_defined_section title="Revenue recognition" parsing_type="b-tag;i-tag;">We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods to the customer in an amount
the reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods in accordance with the provisions of ASC
606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".
<company_defined_section title="Stock Compensation" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">We record stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions set forth in ASC 718.
ASC 718 requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon
the grant date fair value of those awards. We, from time to time, may issue common stock to acquire services or goods from non-employees.
Common stock issued to persons other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Business Combinations" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this
method, acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and any assumed liabilities are recorded at their acquisition
date estimated fair value. The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves
the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
-19-
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Goodwill" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Judgements regarding indicators of potential
impairment are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business. If management concludes, based on its assessment
of relevant events, facts and circumstances that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its
fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount in excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated
to that reporting unit.
Our management determined that a triggering event to assess goodwill impairment occurred during
the year ending June 30, 2020 due to the separation of a key executive associated with the acquisition of Concepts and Solutions. While
there was no single determinative event, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the year of 2020 led management
to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain intangible assets and goodwill acquired as part of that acquisition
were below their carrying amounts. These factors included: a) former key executive separating from us; b) respective former key executive
violating his noncompete changing the use and value of it; c) sustained decrease in our share price which reduced market capitalization;
and d) uncertainty in the United States and global economies beginning in March 2020 due to COVID-19. As a result of the impairment test,
an impairment loss of $2,000,287, including $800,287 related to goodwill and $1,200,000 related to finite-lived intangible assets was
recorded during the year ended June 30, 2020.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Intangible Assets" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">Intangible assets are stated at the lower of cost or fair value. Intangible assets are amortized
on a straight- line basis over periods ranging from two to five years, representing the period over which we expect to receive future
economic benefits from these assets.
As noted above, we determined certain intangible assets were impaired during the year ended
June 30, 2020.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Derivative Liabilities" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">We classify warrants and embedded conversion features on convertible debt as derivative liabilities
due to protection provisions within the agreements. Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value using the Monte Carlo
model and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period. The derivative liabilities represent a Level 3 financial
instrument. We account for derivative instruments and debt instruments in accordance with ASC 815, ASU 2017-11, and associated pronouncements
related to the classification and measurement of warrants and instruments with conversion features. ASU 2020-06, Complex Financial Instruments,
changes the way we account for derivative liabilities and will be adopted early on July 1, 2021, as permitted by the ASU. The impact of
adopting ASU 2020-06 will be disclosed in the financial statement footnotes, as well as on our next quarterly report.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;i-tag;">For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption
and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Part II, Item 8, Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies" to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.

Statements of Operations for the periods indicated. The first table is a representation of our quarter-over-quarter performance to break
out the activity in Q4 which is reported within the year end data of the financial reports. The second table represents an annual comparison
as noted below.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Revenue" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Total revenues recognized were $3,773,605 and $2,319,852 for the years ended June 30, 2021
and 2020, respectively, an increase of 63%. Additionally, deferred revenue amounted to $453,862 and $1,133,992 as of June 30, 2021 and
2020, respectively. Revenues during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 substantially consisted of revenues from sales of technology
interactive panels and related products, bell paging and intercom installs, and audio amplification OEM sales. &#160;Revenues increased
during the year ended June 30, 2021 due to the increases in the customer base for our products, partially as a result of the pandemic,
as well as additional revenues received through our OEM channel.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Cost of Sales and Gross Profit" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Our cost of sales was $2,077,342 and $1,136,126 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, an increase of approximately 83%. Cost of sales for the year ended June 30, 2021 consists primarily of manufacturing, freight,
amortization of capitalized development and installation costs. Cost of sales for the years ended June 30, 2020 consists primarily of
manufacturing, freight, and installation costs. &#160;Cost of sales increased during the year ended June 30, 2021 consistent with the
increase in revenues. Gross profit decreased slightly due to amortization of capitalized development costs. Our gross profit as a percentage
of total revenues was 45% and 51% for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Total general and administrative expenses (including stock compensation and legal settlement
expenses) were $7,868,529 and $10,928,797 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of 28%. General and administrative
expenses for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 consist primarily of salaries and stock compensation expense, office rent,
travel expense, amortization expense, and professional fees. Of this amount, $2,778,550 and $2,087,425 represent consulting fees and stock
compensation and stock issued for services, which did not impact cash, for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. General
and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2020 also included a non-cash impairment charge of $2,000,287 and a legal settlement
of $2,000,000.
When excluding the non-cash impairment charge taken during the year ended June 30, 2020, general
and administrative expenses decreased to $8,928,510 compared to $7,868,529 for the year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 12%. The decrease
was due to the increase in costs capitalized for product development, offset by a reduction of costs associated with remote and virtual
tradeshows, and other cost savings strategies implemented by management.

<company_defined_section title="-21-" parsing_type="emphasis;">The outstanding warrants and conversion features in convertible notes meet the definition
of a derivative liability instrument because the exercise price of the warrants and the conversion rates are variable. As a result, the
outstanding warrants and conversion features of the notes are recorded as a derivative liability at fair value and marked-to-market each
period with the change in fair value charged or credited to income. A derivative liability of $1,842,000 and $246,612 is recorded at June
30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. A change in fair value of the derivative instruments was accreted by ($1,619,583) and $2,651,957 during the
years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the change in our stock price. These amounts do not impact cash. ASU 2020-06,
Complex Financial Instruments, changes the way we account for derivative liabilities and will be adopted early on July 1, 2021, as permitted
by the ASU. The impact of adopting ASU 2020-06 will be disclosed in the financial statement footnotes, as well as on our next quarterly
report.
<company_defined_section title="Net Loss for the Period" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">As a result of the foregoing, net loss incurred for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020
was $24,434,336 and $14,026,107, respectively, an increase of 74%. Noncash contributing factors for the net loss incurred for the years
ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:
a) $2,778,550 and $2,087,425 represent consulting fees and stock compensation and stock issued
for services for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively;
b) amortization of intangible assets and capitalized development costs for the years ended
June 30, 2021 and 2020 totaling $474,635 and $206,563, respectively; and
c) impairment charges taken of $2,000,287 for the year ended June 30, 2020.
Net loss incurred for the quarters ending June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $641,188 and $3,925,456

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Other than our commitments discussed in Notes 10 and 11 on pages F-25 through F-26 to our
audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2021.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Liquidity and Capital Resources" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Since the merger in June 2018, our revenues generated from operations have been insufficient
to support our operational activities and have been supplemented by the proceeds from the issuance of securities, including equity and
debt issuances. As stated in Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management's ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and, ultimately, the
achievement of operating revenues. If our revenues continue to be insufficient to support our operational activities, we intend to raise
additional capital through the sale of equity securities or borrowings from financial institutions and possibly from related and nonrelated
parties who may in fact lend to us on reasonable terms. Management believes that its actions to secure additional funding will allow us
to continue as a going concern. We currently do not have any committed sources of financing other than our line of credit, the Amended
and Restated &#160;Equity Purchase Agreement that we entered into with Tysadco Partners LLC on December 29, 2020, and accounts receivable
factoring agreement, each of which requires us to meet certain conditions to utilize. Under the Amended and Restated Equity Purchase Agreement,
we can issue up to an aggregate of $10 million worth of shares of our common stock at June 30, 2021 over a two-year period. Pursuant to
the terms of the Amended and Restated Equity Purchase Agreement, we have the right to direct Tysadco Partners LLC to purchase the lesser
of 500,000 shares of its common stock per sale or 300% of the average shares traded for the 10 days prior to the closing request date,
at a purchase price of 85% of the lowest average daily traded price during the ten trading days commencing on the first trading day following
delivery and clearing of the delivered shares, with a minimum request of $200,000. We have 205,000,000 shares of our common stock available
to issue under the Equity Purchase Agreement at June 30, 2021. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we raised $5,073,438 from the sale
of 655,938,679 shares of our common stock under the Amended and Restated Equity Purchase Agreement. There can be no assurance that we
will meet all or any of the requirements pursuant to our line of credit, our Equity Purchase Agreement, and accounts receivable factoring
agreement, and therefore those financing options may be unavailable to us. There is no guarantee we will be successful in raising capital
outside of our current sources, and if so, that we will be able to do so on favorable terms.

Our cash totaled $541,591 at June 30, 2021, as compared with $412,391 at June 30, 2020, an
increase of $129,200. Net cash of $6,316,265 was used in operations for the year ended June 30, 2021. Net cash of $502,658 was used in
investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021. Net cash of $6,948,123 was provided by financing activities for the year ended
June 30, 2021, primarily due to proceeds from our Amended and Restated Equity Purchase Agreement. The majority of this cash was used in
the investment of product for orders already received to stay ahead of the potential product shortages we may experience in the future.
During the year ended June 30, 2021, we raised $5,073,438 from the sale of 655,938,679 shares of our common stock under the Amended and
Restated Equity Purchase Agreement and $2,697,730 from the issuance of convertible notes
Total liabilities amounted to $8,760,482 and $12,238,073 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively,
primarily consists of borrowings under a line of credit, derivative liability, accounts payable, deferred revenue and related party notes
payable.
To implement our business plan, we may require additional financing. Additional financing
may come from future equity or debt offerings that could result in dilution to our stockholders. Further, current adverse capital and
credit market conditions could limit our access to capital. We may be unable to raise capital or bear an unattractive cost of capital
that could reduce our financial flexibility.
Our long-term liquidity requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate at which
we grow our business and footprint in the industries. To the extent that the funds generated from operations are insufficient to fund
our activities in the long term, we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing. No assurance can be
given that additional financing will be available or that, if it is available, it will be on terms acceptable to us.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;"></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Corporate History, Nature of Business, Mergers and Acquisitions" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Galaxy Next Generation LTD CO. ("Galaxy CO") was organized in the state of Georgia in February 2017 while R&amp;G Sales, Inc. ("R&amp;G") was organized in the state of Georgia in August 2004. Galaxy CO merged with R&amp;G ("common controlled merger") on March 16, 2018, with R&amp;G becoming the surviving company. R&amp;G subsequently changed its name to Galaxy Next Generation, Inc. ("Private Galaxy").
FullCircle Registry, Inc., ("FLCR") is a holding company created for the purpose of acquiring small profitable businesses to provide exit plans for those company's owners. FLCR's subsidiary, FullCircle Entertainment, Inc. ("Entertainment" or "FLCE"), owned and operated Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a fourteen-theater movie complex located in Indianapolis, Indiana.
On June 22, 2018, Private Galaxy consummated a reverse triangular merger whereby Galaxy merged with and into Full Circle Registry, Inc.'s ("FLCR") as a newly formed subsidiary which was formed specifically for the transaction ("Galaxy MS"). The merger resulted in Private Galaxy MS becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLCR. For accounting purposes, the acquisition of Private Galaxy by FLCR is considered a reverse acquisition, an acquisition transaction where the acquired company, Galaxy, is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, notwithstanding the form of the transaction. The primary reason the transaction is being treated as a purchase by Galaxy rather than a purchase by FLCR is that FLCR is a public reporting company, and Private Galaxy's stockholders gained majority control of the outstanding voting power of FLCR's equity securities. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial statements of the Company prior to the merger are those of Private Galaxy. The financial statements after the completion of the merger include the combined assets and liabilities of the combined company (collectively Private Galaxy, FLCR and FLCE).
In recognition of Private Galaxy's merger with FLCR, several things occurred: (1) FLCR amended its articles of incorporation to change its name from FullCircle Registry, Inc. to Galaxy Next Generation, Inc.; (2) the Company changed its fiscal year end to June 30, effective June 2018; (3) the Company's authorized shares of preferred stock were increased to 200,000,000 and authorized shares of common stock were increased to
4,000,000,000 , (prior to the Reverse Stock Split) both with a par value of $
0.0001 ; and (4) the Board of Directors and Executive Officers approved Gary LeCroy, President and Director; Magen McGahee, Secretary and Director; and Carl Austin, Director; and (5) the primary business operated by the combined company became the business that was operated by Private Galaxy.
On September 4, 2019, Galaxy acquired
100 % of the stock of Interlock Concepts, Inc. ("Concepts") and Ehlert Solutions Group, Inc. ("Solutions"). The purchase price for the acquisition was
1,350,000  shares of common stock and a two year note payable to the seller for $
3,000,000 . The note payable to the seller is subject to adjustment based on the achievement of certain future gross revenues and successful completion of certain pre-acquisition withholding tax issues of Concepts and Solutions.
Solutions and Concepts are Utah-based audio design and manufacturing companies creating innovative products that provide fundamental tools for building notification systems primarily to K-12 education market customers located primarily in the north and northwest United States. Solutions and Concepts' products and services allow institutions access to intercom, scheduling, and notification systems with improved ease of use. The products provide an open architecture solution to customers which allows the products to be used in both existing and new environments. Intercom, public announcement (PA), bell and control solutions are easily added and integrated within the open architecture design and software model. These products combine elements over a common internet protocol (IP) network, which minimizes infrastructure requirements and reduces costs by combining systems.
On October 15, 2020, Galaxy acquired the assets of Classroom Technologies Solutions, Inc. ("Classroom Tech") for consideration of (a) paying off a secured Classroom Tech loan, not to exceed the greater of 50% of the value of the Classroom Tech assets acquired or $
120,000 ; (b) the issuance of a promissory note in the amount of $
44,526  to a Classroom Tech designee; and (c) the issuance of
10  million shares of common stock to the seller of Classroom Tech. Classroom Tech provides cutting-edge presentation products to schools, training facilities, churches, corporations and retail establishments. Their high-quality solutions are customized to meet a variety of needs and budgets in order to provide the best in education and presentation technology. Classroom Tech direct-sources and imports many devices and components which allows the Company to be innovative, nimble, and capable of delivering a broad range of cost-effective solutions. Classroom Tech also offers in-house service and repair facilities and carries many top brands.
Galaxy is a manufacturer and U.S. distributor of interactive learning technology hardware and software that allows the presenter and participant to engage in a fully collaborative instructional environment. Galaxy's products include Galaxy's own private-label interactive touch screen panel as well as numerous other national and international branded peripheral and communication devices. New technologies like Galaxy's own touchscreen panels are sold along with renowned brands such as Google Chromebooks, Microsoft Surface Tablets, Lenovo &amp; Acer computers, Verizon WiFi and more. Galaxy's distribution channel consists of approximately 37 resellers across the U.S. who primarily sell its products within the commercial and educational market. Galaxy does not control where the resellers focus their resell efforts; however, the K-12 education market is the largest customer base for Galaxy products comprising nearly 90% of Galaxy's sales. In addition, Galaxy also possesses its own reseller channel where it sells directly to the K-12 market, primarily throughout the Southeast region of the United States.
The Entertainment segment was sold on February 6, 2019 in exchange for
38,625  Galaxy common shares.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="COVID-19 Update" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Covid-19 Pandemic that began in March 2020 caused shelter-in-place policies, unexpected factory closures, supply chain disruptions, and market volatilities across the globe. As a result of the economic disruptions and unprecedented market volatilities and uncertainties driven by the Covid-19 outbreak, the Company experienced some supply chain disruptions. However, the Company has not experienced any significant payment delays or defaults by our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The full impact of the Covid-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. The depth and duration of the pandemic remains unknown. Despite the availability of vaccines, recent surges in the infection rate and the detection of new variants of the virus have reinforced the general consensus that the containment of Covid-19 remains a challenge. Management is actively monitoring the global situation and its effect on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Any reference in these footnotes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB").
The financial statements include the consolidated assets and liabilities of the combined company (collectively Private Galaxy FLCR Interlock Concepts, Inc., Ehlert Solutions Group, Inc., and Classroom Tech, referred to collectively as the "Company"). See Note 12.
All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.
The Company is an over-the-counter public company traded under the stock symbol listing GAXY (formerly FLCR).
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Use of Estimates" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements include those assumed in computing valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of convertible notes payable and warrants, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that the significant estimates used will change within the next year.

There are
244,974,231  issued common shares that are restricted as of June 30, 2021. The shares will become free-trading upon satisfaction of certain terms within the convertible debt agreements.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Business Combinations" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and any assumed liabilities are recorded at their acquisition date estimated fair value. The excess of purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed represents the goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Revenue Recognition" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;"><company_defined_section title="Technology Interactive Panels and Related Products" parsing_type="emphasis;text-decoration:underline;">The Company derives revenue from the sale of interactive panels and other related products. Sales of these panels may also include optional equipment, accessories, and services (installation, training, and other services, maintenance, and warranty services). Product sales and installation revenue are recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: (1) products have been shipped or customers have purchased and accepted title to the goods; service revenue for installation of products sold is recognized as the installation services are performed, (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (3) the price to the customer is fixed, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
Deferred revenue consists of customer deposits and advance billings of the Company's products where sales have not yet been recognized. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue in the accompanying statements of operations. Costs incurred by the Company associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of sales in the accompanying statements of operations. Sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts, and sales are presented net of sales-related taxes.
Because of the nature and quality of the Company's products, the Company provides for the estimated costs of warranties at the time revenue is recognized for a period of five years after purchase as a secondary warranty. The manufacturer also provides a warranty against certain manufacturing and other defects. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company accrued $
108,043  and $
102,350 , respectively, for estimated product warranty claims, which is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The accrued warranty costs are based primarily on historical warranty claims as well as current repair costs. There was $
5,693  and $
82,494  of warranty expense for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The Company negotiated a warranty settlement with one of its manufacturers. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company accrued $
0  and $
124,437  payable to this manufacturer to be paid over 24 months.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Supplier Agreement" parsing_type="emphasis;text-decoration:underline;">Galaxy is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for an audio amplification device used primarily in classrooms under a master supplier contract. The master supplier agreement outlines terms of each purchase order issued under the agreement. The Company is contractually guaranteed reimbursement as a mechanism to collect amounts due from the customer tooling sales. Under this arrangement, amounts due from tooling sales are collected as units are delivered over the supply arrangement. Variable consideration such as discounts are also included in estimating the transaction price are based on reasonably available information. The Company accounts for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of the transaction price thereby reducing the amount of revenue recognized.
In general, Galaxy receives a prepayment with each purchase order to cover upfront costs. The prepayment, a contract liability, is recorded as deferred revenue and released to income as finished products are shipped and received. Contract assets are recorded in accounts receivable. The supplier agreement states that title passes upon receipt. The product is rebranded and sold to customers. The supplier contract was acquired with the Concepts and Solutions acquisition in September 2019. The initial contract was for 1 year with 2 two-year extensions available. The master agreement extensions will expire in September 2024.
Contract assets and contract liabilities are as follows:

For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $
1,467,589  and $
0  of revenues related to supplier agreements.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Cash and Cash Equivalents" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to be cash in all bank accounts, including money market and temporary investments that have an original maturity of three months or less.
From time to time, the Company has on deposit, in institutions whose accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, funds in excess of the insured maximum. The at-risk amount is subject to significant fluctuation daily throughout the year. The Company has never experienced any losses related to these balances, and as such, the Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant risk.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Accounts Receivable" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Accounts receivable is recognized when the Company's right to consideration is unconditional and is presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not charged on past due accounts. Management reviews each receivable balance and estimates that portion, if any, of the balance that will not be collected. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is then reduced by an allowance based on management's estimate. Management deemed no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at June 30, 2021 and 2020. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, $
190,779  and $
670,031  of total accounts receivable were considered unbilled and recorded as deferred revenue.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Inventories" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting and is primarily comprised of interactive panels, audio, intercom and bell products and related accessories. Management estimates $
of inventory reserves at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
67,635
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Property and Equipment" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and additions and improvements that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized. Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Property and equipment and the estimated useful lives used in computing depreciation, are as follows:
Furniture and fixtures
5  years
Equipment
5  to
8  years
Vehicles
5  years
Building
40  years
Building improvements
8  years
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets. Depreciation expense was $16,005 and $29,795 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Long-lived Assets" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the excess of the asset's carrying amount over the fair value of the asset.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Goodwill" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Goodwill is attributed to the reverse merger of FullCircle Registry and the acquisition of Concepts and Solutions. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Judgments regarding indicators of potential impairment are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business.
At each fiscal year-end, the Company performs an impairment analysis of goodwill. The Company may assess its goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and circumstances that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount in excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. If determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded as a general and administrative expense within the Company's consolidated statement of operations. As of June 30, 2020, the only asset required to be measured on a nonrecurring basis was goodwill and the fair value of the asset amounted to $
834,220  using level 3 valuation techniques.
Management determined that a triggering event to assess goodwill impairment occurred in an interim period during the year ending June 30, 2020 due to the separation of a key executive associated with the acquisition of Concepts and Solutions. While there was no single determinative event, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the year of 2020 led management to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain intangible assets and goodwill acquired as part of the Ehlert Solutions Group, Inc and Interlock Concepts, Inc acquisitions were below their carrying amounts. These factors included: a) former key executive separating from us; b) respective former key executive violating his noncompete changing the use and value of it; c) sustained decrease in our share price which reduced market capitalization; and d) uncertainty in the United States and global economies beginning in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the impairment test, the audited results for the year ended 2020 included non-cash impairment losses of $
2,000,287 , comprised of $
800,287  related to goodwill and $1,200,000 related to finite-lived intangible assets. No such impairment of goodwill was noted for the year ended June 30, 2021.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Intangible Assets" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Intangible assets are stated at the lower of cost or fair value. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from
two  to
five years , representing the period over which the Company expects to receive future economic benefits from these assets. The Company acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of Concepts and Solutions. The Company impaired $
1,200,000  of the intangible assets during an interim period of the year ended June 30, 2020. There was no such impairment of intangible assets as of June 30, 2021.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Product Development Costs" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Costs incurred in designing and developing classroom technology products are expensed as research and development until technological feasibility has been established. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detail product design, or in its absence, completion of a working model. Upon the achievement of technological feasibility, development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Management's judgment is required in determining whether a product provides new or additional functionality, the point at which various products enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized, assessing the ongoing value and impairment of the capitalized costs and determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized.
Annual amortization expense is calculated based on the straight-line method over the product's estimated economic lives. Amortization of product development costs incurred begins when the related products are available for general release to customers. Amortization of product development costs of $
195,996  and $
1,536  for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, is included in cost of revenues in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Research and Development" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $
0  for the year ended June 30, 2021. A significant portion of research and development costs were capitalized as development costs during the year ended June 30, 2021. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $
90,654  for the year ended June 30, 2020.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Warranty" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company negotiated a warranty settlement with one of its manufacturers to be paid over twenty-four months. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company accrued $
0  and $
124,437  payable to this manufacturer.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Leases" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company's leases relate primarily to corporate offices and warehouses. Effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB guidance on leases ("Topic 842"), which requires leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition approach.
<company_defined_section title="Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity" parsing_type="font-weight:bold;">The Company relies on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, to classify certain convertible instruments. The Company first determines whether a financial instrument should be classified as a liability. The Company determines a liability classification if the financial instrument is mandatorily redeemable, or if the financial instrument, other than outstanding shares, embodies a conditional obligation that the Company must or may settle by issuing a variable number of its equity shares.
If the Company determines that a financial instrument should not be classified as a liability, the Company determines whether the financial instrument should be presented between the liability section and the equity section of the balance sheet ("temporary equity"). The Company determines temporary equity classification if the redemption of the financial instrument is outside the control of the Company (i.e. at the option of the holder). Otherwise, the Company accounts for the financial instrument as permanent equity.
<company_defined_section title="Initial Measurement" parsing_type="emphasis;text-decoration:underline;">The Company records financial instruments classified as liability, temporary equity, or permanent equity at issuance at the fair value, or cash received.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Subsequent Measurement - Financial Instruments Classified as Liabilities" parsing_type="emphasis;text-decoration:underline;">The Company records the fair value of financial instruments classified as liabilities at each subsequent measurement date. The changes in fair value of financial instruments classified as liabilities are recorded as other income (expense).
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Income Taxes" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Current income taxes are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable or receivable on taxable income or loss from the current year and any adjustment to income taxes payable related to previous years. Current income taxes are determined using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or subsequently enacted by the year-end date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Under the asset and liability method, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be utilized.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Stock-based Compensation" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions set forth in ASC 718, Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards. The Company, from time to time, may issue common stock to acquire services or goods from non-employees. Common stock issued to persons other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value.
<company_defined_section title="Earnings (Loss) per Share" parsing_type="font-weight:bold;">Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company's convertible notes and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they are anti-dilutive due to the Company's losses during those periods.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Fair Value of Financial Instruments" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company categorized its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are significant other observable inputs; Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs.
As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company held certain financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. All such assets and liabilities are considered to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy defined above.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Derivative Liabilities" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The Company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow or market risks. However, certain other financial instruments, such as warrants and embedded conversion features on the convertible debt, are classified as derivative liabilities due to protection provisions within the agreements. Such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value using the Monte Carlo model and subsequently adjusted to fair value at the close of each reporting period. The Company accounts for derivative instruments and debt instruments in accordance with the interpretive guidance of ASC 815, ASU 2017-11, and associated pronouncements related to the classification and measurement of warrants and instruments with conversion features and anti-dilution clauses in agreements.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Recent Accounting Pronouncements" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">In January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-01, "Investments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)-Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815." The ASU is based on a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force and is expected to increase comparability in accounting for these transactions. ASU 2016-01 made targeted improvements to accounting for financial instruments, including providing an entity the ability to measure certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Among other topics, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting. For public business entities, the amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adoption of the new guidance to its consolidated financial statements.

The original issue discount is being amortized over the terms of the convertible notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company amortized $
274,703  and $
340,526  of debt discounts to interest expense and $
382,436  and $

The Company incurred noncash interest prepayment penalties of approximately $
111,000  and $

Convertible notes are subordinate to the bank debt of the Company.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Warrants" parsing_type="emphasis;text-decoration:underline;">The Company issued common stock and warrants as consideration for the convertible notes. The warrants contain certain anti-dilutive clauses that are accounted for as financial derivatives. See Note 8 for common stock issued. Unexercised warrants of
204,771,864  after anti-dilution protection adjustment, were outstanding at June 30, 2020. All outstanding warrants have an original exercise prices of $
4  per share, contain anti-dilution protection clauses, and expire
36 months  from issue date. The anti-dilution clause was triggered for outstanding warrants, which now have an exercise price below $
4  per share. As of
June 30, 2020 , outstanding warrants expire
between November 29, 2021 and November 18, 2022 . There are no unexercised warrants outstanding at June 30, 2021.
The warrants meet the definition of a derivative liability instrument because the exercise price is variable and therefore does not meet the "fixed-for-fixed" criteria outlined in ASC 815-40-15. As a result, the value of unexercised warrants is recorded as a derivative liability at fair value and marked-to-market each period with the changes in fair value each period charged or credited to other income (expense).

The Company measures the fair market value of the Level 3 liability components using the Monte Carlo model and projected discounted cash flows, as appropriate. These models were initially prepared by an independent third party and consider management's best estimate of the conversion price of the stock, an estimate of the expected time to conversion, an estimate of the stock's volatility, and the risk-free rate of return expected for an instrument with a term equal to the duration of the convertible note.
The significant unobservable valuation inputs for the convertible notes include an expected rate of return of 0%, a risk-free rate of 0.17% and volatility of 295%.

The Company&#8217;s policy is to provide for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company has not generated taxable income and has not recorded any current income tax expense at June 30, 2021 and 2020.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred taxes is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differenced become deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
The Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of net operating losses (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) that give rise to deferred tax assets. The NOL carryforwards expire over a range from
2021  to
2037 , with certain NOL carryforwards that have no expiration. There is no tax benefit for goodwill impairment, which is permanently non-deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, due to the uncertainty of the utilization of NOL carry forwards, a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets has been recorded.
The significant components of deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, are as follows:

As of June 30, 2021, the Company does not believe that it has taken any tax positions that would require the recording of any additional tax liability nor does it believe that there are any unrealized tax benefits that would either increase or decrease within the next twelve months. As of June 30, 2021, the Company&#8217;s income tax returns generally remain open for examination for three years from the date filed with each taxing jurisdiction.

The Company&#8217;s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company&#8217;s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.

Management of the Company determined that a triggering event to assess the impairment of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Concepts and Solutions occurred during the third quarter of 2020. While there was no single event, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during this quarter led management to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair values of certain intangible assets and goodwill acquired as part of the acquisition were below their carrying amounts. See Note 1.
The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date through pushdown accounting. The preliminary allocation to certain assets and/or liabilities may be adjusted by material amounts as the Company finalizes fair value estimates.

3,760,287  and reflected in the balance sheet as of September 30, 2019. Goodwill and other intangible assets recognized is primarily attributable to the amount of the consideration in excess of the fair value of Concepts and Solutions at the date of purchase.

The Plan is intended to attract and retain employees, directors, and consultants by aligning the economic interest of such individuals more closely with the Company's stockholders, by paying fees or salaries in the form of shares of the Company's common stock. The 2020 Plan is effective September 16, 2020 and expires December 15, 2021. The 2019 Plan is effective December 13, 2018 and expired June 1, 2020. Common shares of

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Note 14 &#8211; Going Concern" parsing_type="emphasis;font-weight:bold;">The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, an equity deficit of approximately $1,400,000 and cash used in operations of approximately $6,300,000 at June 30, 2021.
The Company's operational activities has primarily been funded through issuance of common stock for services, related party advances, debt financing, a private placement offering of common stock and through the deferral of accounts payable and other expenses. The Company intends to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities or borrowings from financial institutions and possibly from related and nonrelated parties who may in fact lend to the Company on reasonable terms. Management believes that its actions to secure additional funding will allow the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving any of these objectives. These sources of working capital are not assured, and consequently do not sufficiently mitigate the risks and uncertainties disclosed above. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon management's ability to raise capital from the sale of its equity and, ultimately, the achievement of operating revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures ("Disclosure Controls") as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. The Disclosure Controls evaluation
was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive
officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer). Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to
reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
Disclosure Controls are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The evaluation of our Disclosure Controls included a review of the controls' objectives and
design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Annual Report.
Throughout the course of our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, we advised our Board of Directors that we had
identified a material weakness as defined under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. The material weakness we identified is discussed in "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting" below. Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as a result of the material weakness,
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our Disclosure Controls were not effective.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting" parsing_type="b-tag;">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting; as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.
Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due
to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, including our principal operating officer and principal accounting officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework(2013).
Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that there is a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness relates to the fact that our management is relying on external consultants
for purposes of preparing its financial reporting package; however, the officers may not be able to identify errors and irregularities
in the financial reporting package before its release as a continuous disclosure document.
We continue to engage an outside CPA with SEC related experience to assist in correction of
these material weaknesses. In addition, we continue to appoint an accountant to provide financial statements on a monthly basis and to
assist with the preparation of our SEC financial reports, which allows for proper segregation of duties as well as additional manpower
for proper documentation.
Because of the material weakness described above, management concluded that, as of June 30,
2021 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by COSO (2013). There has been no change in our internal controls that occurred during our most recent fiscal period
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, our internal controls.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public
accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's
registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit smaller reporting companies like us to provide only management's
report in this annual report.

No changes have occurred in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during

-25-
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Code of Ethics" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the Company's officers, and directors.
Our Code of Ethics was included as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
<company_defined_section title="DELINQUENT SECTION 16(A) REPORTS" parsing_type="all caps;b-tag;">Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and officers, and persons
who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of beneficial ownership and
changes in beneficial ownership of the Company's securities with the SEC on Forms 3, 4 and 5. Officers, directors and greater than 10%
stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on the Company's review of the copies of the forms received by it during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and written representations that no other reports were required, the Company does not believe that any
persons required to make filings under Section 16(a) during such fiscal year failed to file such reports or filed such reports late other
than Ms. McGahee &#160;who filed a late Form 4 (i) on November 17, 2020 reporting 30 transactions involving the purchase of common stock
from April 1, 2020 through July 31, 2020; (ii) on November 17, 2020 reporting 9 transactions involving the purchase of common stock from
August 3, 2020 through November 10, 2020 and (iii) on December 1, 2020 reporting 2 transactions involving the purchase of common stock
on November 25, 2020.
<company_defined_section title="Corporate Governance" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors
to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable
governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs
the Company's employees, officers and directors as the Company is not required to do so.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Committees of the Board" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">Our Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees
performing similar functions nor does the Company have a written nominating, compensation, or audit committee charter. The Board of Directors
believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the functions of such committees can be adequately performed
by the Board of Directors.
In lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company's Board of Directors, is responsible for reviewing
and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual
audit of the Company's financial statements and other services provided by the Company's independent public accountants. The Board of
Directors reviews the Company's internal accounting controls, practices, and policies.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Audit Committee Financial Expert" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as
an "audit committee financial expert " as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K.
We believe that our directors are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements
and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director
who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances
given the stage of our development.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Board Meetings and Annual Meeting" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, our Board of Directors held one formal meeting.
We did not hold an annual meeting during that time period. All of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of
Directors.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Code of Business Conduct And Ethics" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">Each of the Company's directors and employees, including its executive officers, are required
to conduct themselves in accordance with ethical standards set forth in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by the Board of
Directors. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics was previously filed with the Commission. Any amendments to or waivers from the code
will be posted on our website. Information on our website does not constitute part of this filing.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Shareholder Proposals" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to
submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific
nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. The Company
does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any
specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management
or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment to the Board.

stockholders. We intend to establish formal policies and procedures in the future, once we have sufficient resources and have appointed
additional directors, so that such transactions will be subject to the review, approval or ratification of our Board of Directors, or
an appropriate committee thereof. On a moving forward basis, our directors will continue to approve any related party transaction.
