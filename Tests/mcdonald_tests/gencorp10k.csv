Aerospace and Defense
For nearly 70 years, Aerojet-General Corporation (Aerojet) has been a trusted supplier of highly sophisticated
products and systems for military, civil and commercial space customers and has maintained strong market positions across various businesses that are mission-critical to national defense and U.S. access to space. We are a leading technology-based
designer, developer and manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems for the U.S. government, specifically the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and major
aerospace, defense and commercial prime contractors. We believe we are the only domestic provider of all four propulsion types (solid, liquid, air-breathing and electric) for space,

Defense systems   Our defense system products include liquid, solid, and air-breathing propulsion systems and components. In
addition, Aerojet is a supplier of both composite and metallic aerospace structural components, and warhead and armament systems for precision tactical and long range weapon applications. Product applications for our defense systems include
strategic, tactical and precision strike missiles, missile defense systems, maneuvering propulsion systems, precision war-fighting systems, and specialty metal products.

Space systems   Our space system products include liquid, solid, and electric propulsion systems and components. Product platform
applications for space systems include expendable and reusable launch vehicles, transatmospheric vehicles, manned and unmanned spacecraft, separation and maneuvering systems, upper stage engines, satellites, large solid boosters, and integrated
propulsion subsystems.

Our Competitive Strengths

Demonstrated History of Product Innovation and Technological Leadership

Diversified and Well Balanced Portfolio
 Aerojet has been a pioneer in the development of many crucial technologies and products that have strengthened multiple branches of the U.S.
military and enabled the exploration of space. We believe Aerojet maintains a unique competitive position due to a strategic focus to create and maintain a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for
our innovative energy management technologies. The resulting product line diversity has enabled us to continue to grow while avoiding significant revenue reductions experienced by concentrated portfolios. We have further capitalized on this
foundation by bringing together our solid and liquid propulsion teams and cross-pollinating critical product features and capabilities thus exploiting potential product line synergies thereby offering customers
innovative and advanced solutions.
We believe Aerojet is well positioned to benefit from DoD investment in
high-priority systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations, and in the development of systems that meet evolving threats worldwide. We believe Aerojet
is also well positioned to support NASA through our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing work on both traditional and emerging launch vehicles.

High Visibility of Revenue with Multi-year Contracts and Sizable
Backlog

Significant Barriers to Entry 
Additionally, we benefit from significant customer funding of our research and development expenditures, which helps position us for long-term production contracts on products we develop. A substantial
portion of our business, including many of our contracts with major prime contractors to the U.S. government, the DoD, or NASA, also requires lengthy customer certification and qualification processes, which create significant obstacles for
potential competitors. As such, we are the sole provider on the vast majority of our contracts. In addition, new programs and platforms favor suppliers with extensive industry experience and a reputation for superior performance.
Indeed, the nature of these barriers is such that even firms established in one market niche find it difficult to enter an
adjacent market niche.

Exceptional Long-Term Industry Relationships

Competition
As the only domestic supplier of all four propulsion types  solid, liquid, air-breathing, and electric  we
believe that Aerojet is in a unique competitive position.
The nature of the markets in which Aerojet operates
varies. In some markets (especially in larger systems), the market is characterized by a few large, long-term programs, intermittent new program starts (with new buys spread further out in periods of declining budgets) and, therefore, relatively few
new competitive awards. In these markets there tend to be few participants each with longstanding legacy positions. Thus, as noted above, the bulk of Aerojets revenues is derived from sole source contracts where Aerojet is the long-term
incumbent.
In other markets, the dynamics can be different, with more numerous, but smaller awards and a
larger number of competitors. The basis on which Aerojet competes in the Aerospace and Defense industry varies by program, but generally is based upon technology, quality, service, and price. Although market competition in certain sectors can be
intense, we believe Aerojet possesses innovative and advanced propulsion and armament solutions, combined with adequate resources to continue to compete successfully.

Industry Overview
For the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ending September 30, 2012 and beyond, federal department/agency
budgets are expected to remain under severe pressure due to the financial impacts from spending cap agreements contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as from ongoing military operations and the cumulative effects of annual federal
budget deficits and rising U.S. federal debt. As a result, the DoD budget is expected to decrease by $21 billion for GFY 2012 relative to the Obama Administration (the Administration) requested level and by $46 billion in the GFY 2013
budget request to be submitted by the Administration in February 2012. The NASA budget will decline by $924 million for GFY 2012 relative to the Administrations requested level and is expected to decline slightly for GFY 2013.
Nevertheless, Aerojet is well-positioned to benefit from continued DoD investment in high priority transformational
systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations in the Middle East, and systems that meet new worldwide threats. The Administration has indicated a
commitment to maintain adequate, albeit lower levels of funding for the DoD than those experienced during the height of conflicts in the Middle East while building defense capabilities for the 21st century. Priority areas that impact our products
include: fully equipping U.S. forces for the missions they face; maintaining situational awareness; preserving air supremacy; maintaining forces at sea; ensuring access to and freedom of space; and developing pragmatic and cost effective missile
defense systems.
In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act (the Authorization Act) took effect impacting
GFYs 2011-2013. The Authorization Act aimed to: safely retire the Space Shuttle; extend the International Space Station through 2020; continue the development of the multipurpose crew exploration vehicle; build a new heavy lift launch vehicle;
invest in new space technologies; and sustain and grow the science and aeronautics programs at NASA. We are well-positioned to succeed among our competitors due to our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing contracts with both
traditional and emerging launch providers. Additionally, we are the main propulsion provider for the multipurpose crew vehicle and plan to compete for elements of the newly announced heavy lift launch vehicle. However, funding levels for both GFY
2011 and GFY 2012 were both below the authorized level, and we anticipate this trend continuing in GFY 2013.
As a part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 or, the Act (Public Law 112-25) (the debt-ceiling and
deficit-reduction compromise agreement signed into law on August 2, 2011), approximately $487 billion in defense spending cuts over the next ten years have been initiated in GFY 2012 appropriations measures and the GFY

Major Customers
As a merchant supplier to the Aerospace and Defense industry, we align ourselves with single prime contractors on a project-by-project basis. We believe that our position as a merchant supplier has helped
us become a trusted partner to our customers, enabling us to maintain strong, long-term relationships with a variety of prime contractors. Under each of our contracts, we act either as a prime contractor, where we sell directly to the end user, or
as a subcontractor, where we sell our products to other prime contractors. The principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government.

Space Systems 
Aerojets commitment to quality and excellence in
its space systems programs was reflected in its 100% success rate on its numerous space exploration, military and commercial missions during fiscal 2011. Among these were the final flight of the Space Shuttle program, the rescue of the Advanced
Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) military communications satellite, and perhaps best illustrating the reach of Aerojets Space product lines was the launch of NASAs Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). The MSL mission
relies on 48 different Aerojet propulsive elements ranging from four large solid boosters to the space craft landing thrusters and all the in-space propulsion that is required in between.
These continued space program successes strengthen our legacy of supplying mission critical propulsion systems to the DoD
and NASA as we have since the inception of the U.S. civil and military space programs and support our position as a critical supplier to our space systems customers.

Contract Types
Under each of its contracts, Aerojet acts either as a prime contractor, where it sells directly to the end user, or as a
subcontractor, selling its products to other prime contractors. Research and development contracts are awarded during the inception stage of a programs development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature
products for operational use. Aerojets contracts are primarily categorized as either fixed-price or cost-reimbursable. During fiscal 2011, approximately 53% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts, 41% from
cost-reimbursable contracts, and 6% from other sales including commercial contracts and real estate activities.
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price
level of effort contracts. For fixed-price contracts, Aerojet performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs of performance. For fixed-price-incentive contracts, Aerojet receives increased
or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the
customers labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in losses.
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet typically
receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet receives
adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule.
Many programs under contract have product life cycles exceeding ten years, such as the Atlas V, Standard Missile,
Hawk, TOW, and Tomahawk programs. It is typical for U.S. government propulsion contracts to be relatively small during development phases that can last from two to five years, followed by low-rate and then full-rate production, where annual
funding can grow significantly.

Government Contracts and Regulations
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), agency-specific
regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoDs Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to
government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractors failure to comply with these regulations and requirements
could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from
government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)
and other government agencies. These agencies review a contractors performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA and other government agencies also review the adequacy of, and a
contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and material management and accounting information systems.

Research and Development
We view research and development efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we
compete. We maintain an active research and development effort supported primarily by customer funding. We believe that some customer-funded research and development expenditures that are subject to contract specifications may become key programs in
the future. We believe customer-funded research and development activities are vital to our ability to compete for contracts and to enhance our technology base.
Aerojets company-funded research and development efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well
as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes.

Suppliers, Raw Materials and Seasonality
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances
beyond Aerojets control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to Aerojets program performance and cost.
Availability of raw materials and supplies to Aerojet has been generally sufficient. Aerojet is sometimes dependent, for a
variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and has, in some instances, in the past

Intellectual Property
Where appropriate, Aerojet
obtains patents and trademarks in the U.S. and other countries covering various aspects of the design and manufacture of its products. We rely on a combination of patents in targeted areas of technology relating to our business, along with
trade secret protections for other competitively-sensitive technologies and intellectual properties used in the business, to maintain our competitive edge in the markets in which we compete. We use patents selectively both (i) to protect
specific inventions whose characteristics and features would be obvious to competitors, such as mechanical designs or structures and (ii) to establish that we have made inventions in particular areas of relevant technologies and thus can
prevent competitors from claiming exclusive rights in those technologies through competing patents. A patent is maintained as long as the underlying invention has value in the market which we compete. A patented invention incorporated into a product
sold will typically be maintained to its explanation, approximately 20 years. We rely more extensively on trade secrets to protect specific inventions whose characteristics and features are not obvious to competitors, such as propellant formulations
or materials and manufacturing processes and procedures, to protect significant intellectual properties. Therefore, no single patent or group of patents is material to us, as we do not rely on patents alone to protect our intellectual property
rights that are the basis for our competitive posture. Trade secrets that are protected under applicable state and federal laws are maintained in perpetuity.

Real Estate
We own approximately 12,200 acres of land
in the Sacramento metropolitan area which we refer to as the Sacramento Land. Acquired in the early 1950s for our aerospace and defense operations, there were large portions used solely to provide safe buffer zones. Modern changes in propulsion
technology coupled with the relocation of certain of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to reposition this excess Sacramento Land,
re-entitle it for new uses, and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.

The environmentally restricted acreage described above is subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our
historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been
accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 7(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land.
(2)
The term entitled is generally used to denote the set of local regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested
uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each land zoning proposal and may include permits, general plan amendments, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals
unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and others prior to construction.
(3)
The term limited entitlements is generally used to denote where a project receives a portion, but not all of the set of regulatory
approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested uses, as described in Note 2, above.
(4)
We believe that the operations land is more than adequate for our long-term needs. As we reassess needs in the future, portions of this land may
become available for entitlement.
(5)
We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess
land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time.

Leasing & Other Real Estate
We currently lease approximately 303,000 square feet of office space in Sacramento to various third parties. These
leasing activities generated $6.7 million in revenue in fiscal 2011.
We also own approximately
580 acres of land in Chino Hills, California. This property was used for the manufacture and testing of ordnance. With the sale of our ordnance business in the mid-1990s, we closed this facility and commenced clean-up of the site. We continue
to work with state regulators and the City of Chino Hills to complete those efforts. Once the remediation is complete, we will assess options and work to maximize the value of the property.

Environmental Matters
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign
environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and
protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a
normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop.
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered.
Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures
eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million. Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs associated with
Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of operations.
Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. See additional information below.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of the
Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):

Our applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the Northrop
Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and Baldwin Park Operable Unit
(BPOU) site environmental reserve until an arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement

Employees
As of November 30, 2011, 12% of our 3,268 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In June
2011, we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with substantially all of our covered employees through June 2014. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
Item 1A.
Risk Factors

The cancellation or material modification of one or more significant contracts could adversely affect our financial results.
Sales, directly and indirectly, to the U.S. government and its agencies accounted for approximately 93% of our total
net sales in fiscal 2011. Our contracts typically permit the U.S. government to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time. The cancellation of one or more significant contracts and/or
programs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize anticipated sales and profits. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government
in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed, and our profit would be limited to work completed prior to termination.

Future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending could adversely affect our financial results.
Our primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD, and its agencies, the government prime
contractors that supply products to these customers, and NASA. As a result, we rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense and space applications and armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems
and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in a large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but
rather follow the cycle of general political support for this

Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S.
government.
U.S. government agencies, including the DCAA and various agency Inspectors General,
routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractors performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The U.S. government also reviews
the adequacy of, and a contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, accounting, and information systems. Any costs found to
be misclassified may be subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of
profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.

If we experience cost overruns on our contracts, we would have to absorb the excess costs which could adversely
affect our financial results and our ability to win new contracts.
In fiscal 2011, approximately 53%
of our net sales was from fixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a fixed price and realize all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in the costs of performing the contract. As a result,
all fixed-price contracts involve the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. To the extent we were to incur unanticipated cost overruns on a program or platform subject to a fixed-price contract, our profitability would be adversely affected.
Future profitability is subject to risks including the ability of suppliers to deliver components of acceptable quality on schedule and the successful implementation of automated tooling in production processes.
In fiscal 2011, approximately 41% of our net sales was from cost reimbursable contracts. Under cost reimbursable
contracts, we agree to be reimbursed for allowable costs and be paid a fee. If our costs are in excess of the final target cost, fees and our margin may be adversely affected. If our costs exceed authorized contract funding or they do not qualify as
allowable costs under applicable regulations, we will not be reimbursed for those costs. Cost overruns may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.

If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual
obligations, our contract performance and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.
We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers and on suppliers to
provide raw materials and component parts for our contract performance. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform
our contractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers could result in our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our
financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.

Our success and growth in our Aerospace and
Defense segment depends on our ability to execute longstanding programs and periodically secure new contracts.
Aerojets revenue is primarily derived form longstanding contracts (often sole source) where Aerojet is the long-term incumbent. The challenge for Aerojet is to utilize its technical, engineering,
manufacturing and management skills to execute these programs well for the customer, to continue to innovate and refine its solutions, and to offer the customer increasing affordability in an era of fiscal restraint. Aeroject has a history of
continuing to innovate even while operating in a sole source environment.
In sectors where there is
competition, it can be intense. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, production, and other resources substantially greater than ours. Although the downsizing of the defense industry in the early 1990s resulted in a reduction in the
aggregate number of competitors, the consolidation has also strengthened the capabilities of some of the remaining competitors. The U.S. government also has its own manufacturing capabilities in some areas. We may be unable to compete successfully
with our competitors and our inability to do so could result in a decrease in sales, profits, and cash flows that we historically have generated from certain contracts. Further, the U.S. government may open to competition programs on which we are
currently the sole supplier, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Our Aerospace and Defense segment is subject to procurement and other related laws and regulations inherent in contracting with the U.S. government, non-compliance with which could adversely affect
our financial results.
In the performance of contracts with the U.S. government, we are subject
to complex and extensive procurement and other related laws and regulations. Possible consequences of a failure to comply, even inadvertently, with these laws and regulations include civil and criminal fines and penalties including, in some cases,
double or triple damages, and suspension or debarment from future government contracts and exporting of goods for a specified period of time.
These laws and regulations provide for ongoing audits and reviews of incurred costs as well as contract procurement, performance and administration. The U.S. government may, if it deems appropriate,
conduct an investigation into possible illegal or unethical activity in connection with these contracts. Investigations of this nature are common in the aerospace and defense industry, and lawsuits may result. In addition, the U.S. government
and its principal prime contractors periodically investigate the financial viability of its contractors and subcontractors as part of its risk assessment process associated with the award of new contracts. If the U.S. government or one or more
prime contractors were to determine that we were not financially viable, our ability to continue to act as a government contractor or subcontractor would be impaired.

We may expand our operations through acquisitions, which may divert managements attention and expose us to
unanticipated liabilities and costs. Also, acquisitions may increase our non-reimbursable costs. We may experience difficulties integrating any acquired operations, and we may incur costs relating to acquisitions that are never consummated.
Our business strategy may lead us to expand our Aerospace and Defense segment through acquisitions.
However, our ability to consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by government regulations, the nu mber of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources, and our ability to obtain
financing. Our success in integrating newly acquired businesses will depend upon our ability to

Our inability to adapt to rapid technological changes could impair our ability to remain competitive.
The aerospace and defense industry continues to undergo rapid and significant technological
development. Our competitors may implement new technologies before us, allowing them to provide more effective products at more competitive prices. Future technological developments could:

adversely impact our competitive position if we are unable to react to these developments in a timely or efficient manner;

require us to write-down obsolete facilities, equipment, and technology;

require us to discontinue production of obsolete products before we can recover any or all of our related research, development and
commercialization expenses; or

require significant capital expenditures for research, development, and launch of new products or processes.

Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology
infrastructure.
We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology
hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. We are constantly updating our information technology infrastructure. Any failure to manage, expand and update our
information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business.
Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other similar disruptions. Any
system failure, successful cyber-attack, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, inappropriate disclosure of
confidential information, or negative publicity, it could harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.

Our implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may adversely affect our
business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
In fiscal 2011, we began implementing a new ERP system that will deliver a new generation of information systems and work
processes. ERP implementations are complex and very time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that take several years. If we do not effectively implement the ERP system or if
the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect financial reporting systems, our ability to produce financial reports, and/or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

We may experience warranty claims for product failures, schedule
delays or other problems with existing or new products and systems.
Many of the products we develop
and manufacture are technologically advanced systems that must function under demanding operating conditions. Even though we believe that we employ sophisticated and rigorous design, manufacturing and testing processes and practices, we may not be
able to successfully launch or manufacture our products on schedule or our products may not perform as intended.
If our products fail to perform adequately, some of our contracts require us to forfeit a portion of our expected profit,
receive reduced payments, provide a replacement product or service or reduce the price of subsequent sales to the same customer. Performance penalties may also be imposed if we fail to meet delivery schedules or other measures of contract
performance. We do not generally insure against potential costs resulting from any required remedial actions or costs or loss of sales due to postponement or cancellation of scheduled operations or product deliveries.

The release or explosion of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt our operations and could
adversely affect our financial results.
Our business operations involve the handling and production of
potentially explosive materials and other dangerous chemicals, including materials used in rocket propulsion and explosive devices. Despite our use of specialized facilities to handle dangerous materials and intensive employee training programs, the
handling and production of hazardous materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our manufacturing operations and could cause production delays. It is possible that a release of these chemicals or an explosion
could result in death or significant injuries to employees and others. Material property damage to us and third parties could also occur. The use of these products in applications by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion or
fire were to occur. Any release or explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages or cause production delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

Disruptions in the supply of key raw materials, difficulties in the supplier qualification
process or increases in prices of raw materials could adversely affect our financial results.
We use a
significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous
customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. We are often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain
the supply. To date we have been successful in establishing replacement materials and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that
supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry and actual pricing is based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price
increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and
appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
We are also
impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. We continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity
metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to negotiate with our customers for economic and/or
price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain
strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms,
increasing the cost risk to our programs.

Our pension plan is currently underfunded and we expect to be required to
make cash contributions in future periods, which may reduce the cash available for our businesses.
As
of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, our total defined benefit pension plan assets, total projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation for our qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4
million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA) requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified
measurement dates. Our funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% funding target ratio required under the PPA. The required funded ratio to be met as
of the November 30, 2011 measurement date is 100%. While the final calculated PPA funded ratio as of November 30, 2011 is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012, we do not anticipate meeting the 100% requirement which could
trigger funding requirements in the future, but not prior to 2013, which is the earliest possible date funding would be required. We do not expect to make significant contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2012. See
additional discussion at Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have accumulated $59.5
million in prepayment credits as of November 30, 2011. Companies may prepay contributions and, under certain circumstances, use those prepayment credits to satisfy the required funding of the pension plans annual required contribution
thereby allowing companies to defer cash payments into the pension plan.
Further, with the Office of Federal
Procurement Policy issuance of the final rule harmonizing Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 412,
Composition and Measurement of Pension Cost , and CAS 413,
Adjustment and Allocation of Pension Cost  with the PPA, on
December 27, 2011, we expect to recover portions of any required pension funding through our government contracts on a more favorable basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of the harmonization of CAS 412 and CAS 413 on our financial
statements.
The funded status of the pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of
the plans assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plans
assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plan could be higher
than we expect. In addition, changes to the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities could adversely affect the funded status of the plan.

The level of returns on retirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation, and other factors affects our financial results.
Our earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee
retirement benefit plans. We calculate the expense for the plans based on actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions that we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators
result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key assumptions used to estimate retirement benefit plan expense for the following year are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our pension expense or income can
also be affected by legislation and other government regulatory actions.

Our operations and properties are currently the subject of significant
environmental liabilities, and the numerous environmental and other government requirements to which we are subject may become more stringent in the future.
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that, among other things, require us to obtain permits to
operate and install pollution control equipment and regulate the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. These requirements may become more stringent in the future. Additional regulations
dictate how and to what level we remediate contaminated soils and the level to which we are required to clean contaminated groundwater. These requirements may also become more stringent in the future. We may also be subject to fines and penalties
relating to the operation of our existing and formerly owned businesses. We have been and are subject to toxic tort and asbestos lawsuits as well as other third-party lawsuits, due to either our past or present use of hazardous substances or the
alleged on-site or off-site contamination of the environment through past or present operations. We may incur material costs in defending these claims and lawsuits and any similar claims and lawsuits that may arise in the future. Contamination at
our current and former properties is subject to investigation and remediation requirements under federal, state and local laws and regulations, and the full extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Any adverse judgment or cash
outlay could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Although some of our environmental costs may be recoverable and we have established reserves, given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may
not be sufficient, which could adversely affect our financial results.
As of November 30, 2011,
the aggregate range of our environmental costs was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million, of which $181.4 million relates to Aerojet sites and $9.2 million relates to non-Aerojet sites.
We believe the accrued amount for future remediation costs represents the costs that could be incurred by us over the contractual term, if any, or the next fifteen years of the estimated remediation, to the extent they are probable and reasonably
estimable. However, in many cases the nature and extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient. We
evaluate the adequacy of those reserves on a quarterly basis, and they could change. In addition, the reserves are based only on known sites and the known contamination at those sites. It is possible that additional sites needing remediation may be
identified or that unknown contamination at previously identified sites may be discovered. It is also possible that the regulatory agencies may change clean-up standards for chemicals of concern such as ammonium perchlorate and trichloroethylene.
This could lead to additional expenditures for environmental remediation in the future and, given the uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient.
Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are
allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the
consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of
operations. However, we are seeking to amend our agreement with the U.S. government to increase the amount allocable to U.S. government contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this pursuit.
Our environmental expenses related to non-Aerojet sites are generally not recoverable and a significant increase in these
estimated environmental expenses could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

We are from time to time subject to significant litigation, the
outcome of which could adversely affect our financial results.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to
material litigation. We may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be very costly and can divert managements efforts. Adverse outcomes in litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

We face certain
significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance.
A significant portion of our business relates to developing and manufacturing propulsion systems for defense and space applications, armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems and munitions
applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
U.S. government. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and
liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Our inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses prospects
and competitive positions.
We seek to protect proprietary technology and inventions through patents
and other proprietary-right protection. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights. In addition, we may incur significant expense in protecting our
intellectual property.
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological
innovation to remain competitive. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may be breached and remedies
for a breach may not be sufficient to compensate us for damages incurred. We generally control and limit access to our product documentation and other proprietary information. Other parties may independently develop our know-how or
otherwise obtain access to our technology.

Business disruptions could seriously affect us.
Our business may be affected by disruptions including, but not limited to: threats to physical
security of our facilities and employees, including senior executives; terrorist acts; information technology attacks or failures; damaging weather or other acts of nature; and pandemics or other public health crises. The costs related to these
events may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. Disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

If our operating subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow or if they are not able to
pay dividends or otherwise distribute their cash to us, or if we have insufficient funds on hand, we may not be able to service our debt.
All of the operations of our Aerospace and Defense and Real Estate segments are conducted through subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service our debt obligations will be largely
dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of our operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these subsidiaries to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or
make other payments or advances to us will depend upon their operating results and cash flows and will be subject to applicable laws and any contractual restrictions contained in the agreements governing their debt, if any.

We have a substantial amount of debt. Our ability to operate is
limited by the agreements governing our debt.
We have a substantial amount of debt for which we are
required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of November 30, 2011, we had $326.4 million of debt. Subject to the limits contained
in some of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, we may incur additional debt in the future.
Our
level of debt places significant demands on our cash resources, which could:

make it more difficult to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations;

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash for payments related to our debt, reducing the amount of cash flow available for working
capital, capital expenditures, entitlement of our real estate assets, and other general corporate purposes;

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete;

place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial
resources than we do;

limit our ability to borrow additional funds;

limit our ability to expand our operations through acquisitions; and

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.
If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and fund our operating costs, our liquidity may be
adversely affected.

We are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants
outlined in our debt indentures and agreements that could restrict our operating activities. A failure to comply could result in a default under our second amended and restated credit agreement (the Senior Credit Facility) which would,
if not waived by the lenders which likely would come with substantial cost, accelerate the payment of our debt. A payment default under the Senior Credit Facility could result in cross defaults on our 9 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes (9 1/2% Notes), and 4.0625% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures (4 1/16% Debentures).

Our debt instruments generally contain various restrictive covenants which
include, among others, provisions which may restrict our ability to:

access the full amount of our revolving credit facility and/or incur additional debt;

enter into certain leases;

make certain distributions, investments, and other restricted payments;

cause our restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us;

enter into transactions with affiliates;

create certain liens;

purchase assets or businesses;

sell assets and, if sold, retain excess cash flow from these sales; and

consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
Our secured debt also contains other customary covenants, including, among others, provisions:

relating to the maintenance of the property collateralizing the debt; and

restricting our ability to pledge assets or create other liens.

The real estate market is inherently risky, which could adversely affect our financial results.
Our real estate activities involve significant risks, which could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject
to various risks, including the following:

we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary re-zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental
permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects;

we may be unable to complete environmental remediation or to have state and federal environmental restrictions on our property lifted, which could
cause a delay or abandonment of these projects;

we may be unable to obtain sufficient water sources to service our projects, which may prevent us from executing our plans;

our real estate activities require significant expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us
unable to proceed with our plans;

economic and political uncertainties could have an adverse effect on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials
and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general;

our property is subject to federal, state, and local regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations on our plans;

much of our property is raw land that includes the natural habitats of various endangered or protected wildlife species requiring mitigation;

if our land use plans are approved by the appropriate governmental authorities, we may face lawsuits from those who oppose such plans. Such lawsuits
and the costs associated with such opposition could be material and have an adverse effect on our ability to sell property or realize income from our projects; and

the time frame required for approval of our plans means that we will have to wait years for a significant cash return.

Substantially all of our excess real estate, that we are in the
process of entitling for new opportunities, is located in Sacramento County, California making us vulnerable to changes in economic and other conditions in that particular market.
As a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, our long-term real estate performance and the value of our
properties will depend upon conditions in the Sacramento region, including:

the sustainability and growth of industries located in the Sacramento region;

the financial strength and spending of the State of California;

local real estate market conditions;

changes in neighborhood characteristics;

changes in interest rates; and

real estate tax rates.
If unfavorable economic or other conditions continue in the region, our plans and business strategy could be adversely affected.

We may incur additional costs related to divestitures, which could adversely affect our financial results.
In connection with our divestitures of the Fine Chemicals and GDX Automotive businesses in fiscal 2005
and fiscal 2004, respectively, we have incurred and may incur additional costs, including costs related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in Chartres, France. As part of these and other divestitures, we have provided customary
indemnification to the purchasers for such matters as claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, including warranty and income tax matters, and liability to investigate and remediate certain environmental contamination
existing prior to disposition. These additional costs and the indemnification of the purchasers of our former businesses may require additional cash expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

In order to be successful, we must attract and retain key employees.
Our business has a continuing need to attract large numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel
holding security clearances, to support the growth of the enterprise and to replace individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could
experience higher labor, recruiting, or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet. In addition, our inability to
appropriately plan for the transfer or replacement of appropriate intellectual capital and skill sets critical to us could result in business disruptions and impair our ability to achieve business objectives.

A strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms,
could adversely affect our financial results.
As of November 30, 2011, 12% of our
3,268 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In June 2011, we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with substantially all of our covered employees through June 2014. In the future, if we are unable to
negotiate acceptable new agreements with the unions, upon expiration of the existing contracts, we could experience a strike or work stoppage. Even if we are successful in negotiating new agreements, the new agreements could call for higher wages or
benefits paid to union members, which would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our profitability. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other non-unionized operations were to become
unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs. A strike or other work stoppage in the facilities of any of our major customers or suppliers could also have similar effects on
us.

Due to the nature of our business, our sales levels may fluctuate
causing our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.
Changes in our operating results from quarter to
quarter may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock. Our quarterly and annual sales are affected by a variety of factors that may lead to significant variability in our operating results. In our Aerospace and Defense segment,
sales earned under long-term contracts are recognized either on a cost basis, when deliveries are made, or when contractually defined performance milestones are achieved. The timing of deliveries or milestones may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
In our Real Estate segment, sales of property may be made from time to time, which may result in variability in our operating results and cash flows.

We use estimates in accounting for most of our programs. Changes in our estimates could affect our future financial results.
Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs, and making
assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made
regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impacts of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction
efforts. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Estimates of award and
incentive fees are also used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be
recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may adversely affect our future period operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

New accounting standards could result in changes to our methods of quantifying and recording
accounting transactions, and could affect our financial results.
Changes to generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America arise from new and revised standards, interpretations, the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, and other guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and others. On December 27, 2011, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued its final rule harmonizing CAS 412,
Composition
and Measurement of Pension Cost , and CAS 413,
Adjustment and Allocation of Pension Cost  with the PPA. We are currently evaluating the impact of the harmonization of CAS 412 and CAS 413 on our financial statements. Further, our current
Forward Pricing Rates (FPRs) did not yet reflect the full effect of the PPA and harmonized CAS 412 and 413 requirements at November 30, 2011. The PPA and harmonized CAS 412 and 413 funding requirements are expected to be
incorporated into our FPRs in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

Failure to maintain effective internal
controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Out of period adjustments could require us to restate or revise previously issued financial statements.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to
effectively prevent fraud. We rely on numerous manual processes to manage our business, which increases our risk of having an internal control failure. The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules
requiring public companies to include a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on Form 10-K. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on
the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, if we or our independent registered public
accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if our

Groundwater Cases

South El Monte Operable Unit (SEMOU) Related Cases
In October 2002, Aerojet and approximately 65 other individual and corporate defendants were served with four civil suits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that
sought recovery of costs allegedly incurred or to be incurred in response to the contamination present at the South El Monte Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund site. The plaintiffs claims against Aerojet were based upon
allegations of discharges from a former site in the El Monte area. Aerojet investigations did not identify a credible connection between the contaminants identified by the plaintiff water entities in the SEMOU and those detected at Aerojets
former facility located in El Monte, California, near the SEMOU (East Flair Drive site). The cases served on October 30, 2002 were denominated as follows:

San Gabriel Valley Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority v. Aerojet-General
Corporation, et al.

Southern California Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

The City of Monterey Park v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et
al.
The contamination in the
SEMOU was also subject to a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) naming Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to conduct the remedial design and
remedial action in the SEMOU.
These cases have been settled. Under the settlement, the Water Entities released
Aerojet and the Company from liability for all groundwater contamination in the geographic confines of the SEMOU alleged to have originated from the East Flair Drive site. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court approved and entered a
partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) which also resolved Aerojets liability under the UAO. On August 25, 2011, the Court granted Aerojets motion
for good faith settlement conditioned upon the payment by Aerojet of its second settlement payment on or before December 5, 2011. The Courts approval removes any contribution claims against Aerojet by other defendants. Aerojet paid the
second settlement payment on December 5, 2011 and the Courts Order took effect on December 8, 2011.

Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA)
On July 1, 2009, the County of Sacramento (County) and SCWA filed a complaint against Aerojet and Boeing
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento,
County of Sacramento; Sacramento County Water Agency v. Aerojet-General Corporation and The Boeing Corporation [sic],  Civ. No. 2:09-at-1041. In the
complaint, the County and SCWA alleged that because groundwater contamination from various sources including Aerojet, McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), and the former Mather Air Force Base, was continuing, the County and SCWA
should be awarded unspecified monetary damages as well as declaratory and equitable relief. Aerojet, Boeing, the County and SCWA reached a final settlement effective October 31, 2011 and Aerojets payment obligations under the settlement
were fully satisfied in fiscal 2011. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable (See Note 7(c) and (d) of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Sun Ridge LLC, et al. v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.
In December 2011, Aerojet received notice of a lawsuit styled
Sun Ridge LLC, et al. v.
Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.,  Case No. 34-2011-00114675, filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The complaint, which also names McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), was filed by owners of properties
adjacent to the Aerojet property in Rancho Cordova, California and alleges damages attributable to contamination of groundwater including diminution of property value and increased costs associated with ensuring water supplies in connection with the
real estate development. Aerojet has not been served with the complaint and is reviewing the allegations contained therein. In the event the lawsuit is served on Aerojet, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. Since this matter is in
the early stages, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what the outcome of this complaint will be. Accordingly, no estimate of liability has been accrued for this matter at November 30, 2011.

Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment Claim
The Company previously manufactured products for the automotive industry at a Toledo, Ohio site, which was adjacent to the
Ottawa River. This facility was divested in 1990 and the Company indemnified the buyer for claims and liabilities arising out of certain pre-divestiture environmental matters. In August 2007, the Company, along with numerous other companies,
received from the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service a notice of a NRD Assessment Plan for the Ottawa River and Northern Maumee Bay. A group of PRPs, including the Company, was formed to respond to the NRD assessment and
to pursue funding from the Great Lakes Legacy Act for primary restoration. The restoration project performed by the group consisted of river dredging and land-filling river sediments with a total project cost in the range of approximately $47 to $49
million, one half of which was funded through the Great Lakes Legacy Act and the net project costs to the PRP group was estimated at $23.5 to $24.5 million. The dredging of the river that began in December 2009 has been completed. In February 2011,
the parties reached an agreement on allocation. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of the Companys share of anticipated costs for the NRD matter was $2.1 million to $3.9 million and the accrued amount was $2.1 million which is
included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable. Still unresolved at this time is the actual NRD Assessment itself. It is not possible to predict the outcome,
timing, or the financial impact of these types of assessments, which are typically long processes lasting several years.

Textileather,
Inc. (Textileather)
In 2008, Textileather, the current owner of the former Toledo, Ohio site,
filed a lawsuit against the Company claiming, among other things, that the Company failed to indemnify and defend Textileather for certain contractual environmental obligations. A second suit related to past and future Resource Conservation Recovery
Act (RCRA) closure costs was filed in late 2009. On May 5, 2010, the District Court granted the Companys Motion for Summary Judgment, thereby dismissing the claims in the initial action. Textileather has appealed to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals. Briefs have been filed and oral argument is scheduled for March 2, 2012. There are no District Court ordered dates in the second Textileather suit, but the parties are conducting informal discovery. As of
November 30, 2011, the estimated anticipated costs and accrued amount for the Textileather matter was $2.1 million which is included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter
are recoverable.

Asbestos Litigation
The Company has been, and continues to be, named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury or death due to exposure to asbestos in building materials, products, or in manufacturing operations.
The majority of cases are pending in Texas and Pennsylvania. There were 146 asbestos cases pending as of November 30, 2011.
Given the lack of any significant consistency to claims (i.e., as to product, operational site, or other relevant assertions) filed against the Company, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate
of the future costs of pending claims or unasserted claims. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for such contingencies.

Subpoenas Duces Tecum
On November 23, 2011, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aerojet, entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney in Sacramento, California, acting on behalf of the U.S. of
America, in connection with a subpoena the Company received on January 6, 2010 relating to the allowability of certain costs under its U.S. Government-related prime and subcontracts. In connection with the settlement, the Company paid $3.3
million in fiscal 2011 and agreed not to seek reimbursement for the costs of the investigation and defense of this issue. The investigation focused on certain corporate costs incurred with respect to proxy expenses in 2004 and 2006. The Company
cooperated fully with the investigation.
On September 23, 2010, the Company received a subpoena duces
tecum from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, acting on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General of the DoD, requesting that the Company produce a variety of documents pertaining to the use of certain cost estimating factors under
its contracts with the DoD. The investigation is still in the early stages and no financial demand has been made; accordingly, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what the outcome of this civil investigation will be or the impact,
if any, the investigation may have on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for at November 30, 2011. The Company has and continues to
cooperate fully with the investigation and is responding to the subpoena.

Snappon SA Wrongful Discharge Claims
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a manufacturing facility in Chartres, France owned by Snappon SA, a
subsidiary of the Company, previously involved in the automotive business. In accordance with French law, Snappon SA negotiated with the local works council regarding the implementation of a social plan for the employees. Following the
implementation of the social plan, approximately 188 of the 249 former Snappon employees sued Snappon SA in the Chartres Labour Court alleging wrongful discharge. The claims were heard in two groups. On February 19, 2009, the Versailles Court
of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 2 plaintiffs and based on this, the Court awarded 1.9 million plus interest. On April 7, 2009, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 1 plaintiffs and based on
this, the Court awarded 1.0 million plus interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the Paris Commercial Court, and the claims will
likely be discharged through those proceedings. The Company has accrued a loss contingency of 2.9 million plus interest for this matter.

Aerospace and Defense
For nearly 70 years, Aerojet-General Corporation (Aerojet) has been a trusted supplier of highly sophisticated
products and systems for military, civil and commercial space customers and has maintained strong market positions across various businesses that are mission-critical to national defense and U.S. access to space. We are a leading technology-based
designer, developer and manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems for the U.S. government, specifically the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and major
aerospace, defense and commercial prime contractors. We believe we are the only domestic provider of all four propulsion types (solid, liquid, air-breathing and electric) for space,

Defense systems   Our defense system products include liquid, solid, and air-breathing propulsion systems and components. In
addition, Aerojet is a supplier of both composite and metallic aerospace structural components, and warhead and armament systems for precision tactical and long range weapon applications. Product applications for our defense systems include
strategic, tactical and precision strike missiles, missile defense systems, maneuvering propulsion systems, precision war-fighting systems, and specialty metal products.

Space systems   Our space system products include liquid, solid, and electric propulsion systems and components. Product platform
applications for space systems include expendable and reusable launch vehicles, transatmospheric vehicles, manned and unmanned spacecraft, separation and maneuvering systems, upper stage engines, satellites, large solid boosters, and integrated
propulsion subsystems.

Our Competitive Strengths

Demonstrated History of Product Innovation and Technological Leadership

Diversified and Well Balanced Portfolio
 Aerojet has been a pioneer in the development of many crucial technologies and products that have strengthened multiple branches of the U.S.
military and enabled the exploration of space. We believe Aerojet maintains a unique competitive position due to a strategic focus to create and maintain a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for
our innovative energy management technologies. The resulting product line diversity has enabled us to continue to grow while avoiding significant revenue reductions experienced by concentrated portfolios. We have further capitalized on this
foundation by bringing together our solid and liquid propulsion teams and cross-pollinating critical product features and capabilities thus exploiting potential product line synergies thereby offering customers
innovative and advanced solutions.
We believe Aerojet is well positioned to benefit from DoD investment in
high-priority systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations, and in the development of systems that meet evolving threats worldwide. We believe Aerojet
is also well positioned to support NASA through our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing work on both traditional and emerging launch vehicles.

High Visibility of Revenue with Multi-year Contracts and Sizable
Backlog

Significant Barriers to Entry 
Additionally, we benefit from significant customer funding of our research and development expenditures, which helps position us for long-term production contracts on products we develop. A substantial
portion of our business, including many of our contracts with major prime contractors to the U.S. government, the DoD, or NASA, also requires lengthy customer certification and qualification processes, which create significant obstacles for
potential competitors. As such, we are the sole provider on the vast majority of our contracts. In addition, new programs and platforms favor suppliers with extensive industry experience and a reputation for superior performance.
Indeed, the nature of these barriers is such that even firms established in one market niche find it difficult to enter an
adjacent market niche.

Exceptional Long-Term Industry Relationships

Competition
As the only domestic supplier of all four propulsion types  solid, liquid, air-breathing, and electric  we
believe that Aerojet is in a unique competitive position.
The nature of the markets in which Aerojet operates
varies. In some markets (especially in larger systems), the market is characterized by a few large, long-term programs, intermittent new program starts (with new buys spread further out in periods of declining budgets) and, therefore, relatively few
new competitive awards. In these markets there tend to be few participants each with longstanding legacy positions. Thus, as noted above, the bulk of Aerojets revenues is derived from sole source contracts where Aerojet is the long-term
incumbent.
In other markets, the dynamics can be different, with more numerous, but smaller awards and a
larger number of competitors. The basis on which Aerojet competes in the Aerospace and Defense industry varies by program, but generally is based upon technology, quality, service, and price. Although market competition in certain sectors can be
intense, we believe Aerojet possesses innovative and advanced propulsion and armament solutions, combined with adequate resources to continue to compete successfully.

Industry Overview
For the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ending September 30, 2012 and beyond, federal department/agency
budgets are expected to remain under severe pressure due to the financial impacts from spending cap agreements contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as from ongoing military operations and the cumulative effects of annual federal
budget deficits and rising U.S. federal debt. As a result, the DoD budget is expected to decrease by $21 billion for GFY 2012 relative to the Obama Administration (the Administration) requested level and by $46 billion in the GFY 2013
budget request to be submitted by the Administration in February 2012. The NASA budget will decline by $924 million for GFY 2012 relative to the Administrations requested level and is expected to decline slightly for GFY 2013.
Nevertheless, Aerojet is well-positioned to benefit from continued DoD investment in high priority transformational
systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations in the Middle East, and systems that meet new worldwide threats. The Administration has indicated a
commitment to maintain adequate, albeit lower levels of funding for the DoD than those experienced during the height of conflicts in the Middle East while building defense capabilities for the 21st century. Priority areas that impact our products
include: fully equipping U.S. forces for the missions they face; maintaining situational awareness; preserving air supremacy; maintaining forces at sea; ensuring access to and freedom of space; and developing pragmatic and cost effective missile
defense systems.
In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act (the Authorization Act) took effect impacting
GFYs 2011-2013. The Authorization Act aimed to: safely retire the Space Shuttle; extend the International Space Station through 2020; continue the development of the multipurpose crew exploration vehicle; build a new heavy lift launch vehicle;
invest in new space technologies; and sustain and grow the science and aeronautics programs at NASA. We are well-positioned to succeed among our competitors due to our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing contracts with both
traditional and emerging launch providers. Additionally, we are the main propulsion provider for the multipurpose crew vehicle and plan to compete for elements of the newly announced heavy lift launch vehicle. However, funding levels for both GFY
2011 and GFY 2012 were both below the authorized level, and we anticipate this trend continuing in GFY 2013.
As a part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 or, the Act (Public Law 112-25) (the debt-ceiling and
deficit-reduction compromise agreement signed into law on August 2, 2011), approximately $487 billion in defense spending cuts over the next ten years have been initiated in GFY 2012 appropriations measures and the GFY

Major Customers
As a merchant supplier to the Aerospace and Defense industry, we align ourselves with single prime contractors on a project-by-project basis. We believe that our position as a merchant supplier has helped
us become a trusted partner to our customers, enabling us to maintain strong, long-term relationships with a variety of prime contractors. Under each of our contracts, we act either as a prime contractor, where we sell directly to the end user, or
as a subcontractor, where we sell our products to other prime contractors. The principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government.
Customers that represented more than 10% of net sales for the fiscal years presented are as follows:

Space Systems 
Aerojets commitment to quality and excellence in
its space systems programs was reflected in its 100% success rate on its numerous space exploration, military and commercial missions during fiscal 2011. Among these were the final flight of the Space Shuttle program, the rescue of the Advanced
Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) military communications satellite, and perhaps best illustrating the reach of Aerojets Space product lines was the launch of NASAs Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). The MSL mission
relies on 48 different Aerojet propulsive elements ranging from four large solid boosters to the space craft landing thrusters and all the in-space propulsion that is required in between.
These continued space program successes strengthen our legacy of supplying mission critical propulsion systems to the DoD
and NASA as we have since the inception of the U.S. civil and military space programs and support our position as a critical supplier to our space systems customers.

Contract Types
Under each of its contracts, Aerojet acts either as a prime contractor, where it sells directly to the end user, or as a
subcontractor, selling its products to other prime contractors. Research and development contracts are awarded during the inception stage of a programs development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature
products for operational use. Aerojets contracts are primarily categorized as either fixed-price or cost-reimbursable. During fiscal 2011, approximately 53% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts, 41% from
cost-reimbursable contracts, and 6% from other sales including commercial contracts and real estate activities.
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price
level of effort contracts. For fixed-price contracts, Aerojet performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs of performance. For fixed-price-incentive contracts, Aerojet receives increased
or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the
customers labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in losses.
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet typically
receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet receives
adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule.
Many programs under contract have product life cycles exceeding ten years, such as the Atlas V, Standard Missile,
Hawk, TOW, and Tomahawk programs. It is typical for U.S. government propulsion contracts to be relatively small during development phases that can last from two to five years, followed by low-rate and then full-rate production, where annual
funding can grow significantly.

Government Contracts and Regulations
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), agency-specific
regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoDs Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to
government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractors failure to comply with these regulations and requirements
could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from
government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)
and other government agencies. These agencies review a contractors performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA and other government agencies also review the adequacy of, and a
contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and material management and accounting information systems.

backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond our control. Of our November 30, 2011 total contract backlog, approximately 46%, or $654.0 million, is expected to be filled within one year.

Research and Development
We view research and development efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we
compete. We maintain an active research and development effort supported primarily by customer funding. We believe that some customer-funded research and development expenditures that are subject to contract specifications may become key programs in
the future. We believe customer-funded research and development activities are vital to our ability to compete for contracts and to enhance our technology base.
Aerojets company-funded research and development efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well
as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes.

Suppliers, Raw Materials and Seasonality
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances
beyond Aerojets control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to Aerojets program performance and cost.
Availability of raw materials and supplies to Aerojet has been generally sufficient. Aerojet is sometimes dependent, for a
variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and has, in some instances, in the past

Intellectual Property
Where appropriate, Aerojet
obtains patents and trademarks in the U.S. and other countries covering various aspects of the design and manufacture of its products. We rely on a combination of patents in targeted areas of technology relating to our business, along with
trade secret protections for other competitively-sensitive technologies and intellectual properties used in the business, to maintain our competitive edge in the markets in which we compete. We use patents selectively both (i) to protect
specific inventions whose characteristics and features would be obvious to competitors, such as mechanical designs or structures and (ii) to establish that we have made inventions in particular areas of relevant technologies and thus can
prevent competitors from claiming exclusive rights in those technologies through competing patents. A patent is maintained as long as the underlying invention has value in the market which we compete. A patented invention incorporated into a product
sold will typically be maintained to its explanation, approximately 20 years. We rely more extensively on trade secrets to protect specific inventions whose characteristics and features are not obvious to competitors, such as propellant formulations
or materials and manufacturing processes and procedures, to protect significant intellectual properties. Therefore, no single patent or group of patents is material to us, as we do not rely on patents alone to protect our intellectual property
rights that are the basis for our competitive posture. Trade secrets that are protected under applicable state and federal laws are maintained in perpetuity.

Real Estate
We own approximately 12,200 acres of land
in the Sacramento metropolitan area which we refer to as the Sacramento Land. Acquired in the early 1950s for our aerospace and defense operations, there were large portions used solely to provide safe buffer zones. Modern changes in propulsion
technology coupled with the relocation of certain of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to reposition this excess Sacramento Land,
re-entitle it for new uses, and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.

The environmentally restricted acreage described above is subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our
historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been
accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 7(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land.
(2)
The term entitled is generally used to denote the set of local regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested
uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each land zoning proposal and may include permits, general plan amendments, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals
unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and others prior to construction.
(3)
The term limited entitlements is generally used to denote where a project receives a portion, but not all of the set of regulatory
approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested uses, as described in Note 2, above.
(4)
We believe that the operations land is more than adequate for our long-term needs. As we reassess needs in the future, portions of this land may
become available for entitlement.
(5)
We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess
land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time.

Leasing & Other Real Estate
We currently lease approximately 303,000 square feet of office space in Sacramento to various third parties. These
leasing activities generated $6.7 million in revenue in fiscal 2011.
We also own approximately
580 acres of land in Chino Hills, California. This property was used for the manufacture and testing of ordnance. With the sale of our ordnance business in the mid-1990s, we closed this facility and commenced clean-up of the site. We continue
to work with state regulators and the City of Chino Hills to complete those efforts. Once the remediation is complete, we will assess options and work to maximize the value of the property.

Environmental Matters
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign
environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and
protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a
normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop.
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered.
Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures
eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million. Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs associated with
Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of operations.
Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. See additional information below.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of the
Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):

(BPOU) site environmental reserve until an arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement

Employees
As of November 30, 2011, 12% of our 3,268 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In June
2011, we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with substantially all of our covered employees through June 2014. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Business/Aerospace and Defense","Aerospace and Defense
For nearly 70 years, Aerojet-General Corporation (Aerojet) has been a trusted supplier of highly sophisticated
products and systems for military, civil and commercial space customers and has maintained strong market positions across various businesses that are mission-critical to national defense and U.S. access to space. We are a leading technology-based
designer, developer and manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems for the U.S. government, specifically the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and major
aerospace, defense and commercial prime contractors. We believe we are the only domestic provider of all four propulsion types (solid, liquid, air-breathing and electric) for space,

Defense systems   Our defense system products include liquid, solid, and air-breathing propulsion systems and components. In
addition, Aerojet is a supplier of both composite and metallic aerospace structural components, and warhead and armament systems for precision tactical and long range weapon applications. Product applications for our defense systems include
strategic, tactical and precision strike missiles, missile defense systems, maneuvering propulsion systems, precision war-fighting systems, and specialty metal products.

Space systems   Our space system products include liquid, solid, and electric propulsion systems and components. Product platform
applications for space systems include expendable and reusable launch vehicles, transatmospheric vehicles, manned and unmanned spacecraft, separation and maneuvering systems, upper stage engines, satellites, large solid boosters, and integrated

Our Competitive Strengths

Demonstrated History of Product Innovation and Technological Leadership

Diversified and Well Balanced Portfolio
 Aerojet has been a pioneer in the development of many crucial technologies and products that have strengthened multiple branches of the U.S.
military and enabled the exploration of space. We believe Aerojet maintains a unique competitive position due to a strategic focus to create and maintain a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for
our innovative energy management technologies. The resulting product line diversity has enabled us to continue to grow while avoiding significant revenue reductions experienced by concentrated portfolios. We have further capitalized on this
foundation by bringing together our solid and liquid propulsion teams and cross-pollinating critical product features and capabilities thus exploiting potential product line synergies thereby offering customers
innovative and advanced solutions.
We believe Aerojet is well positioned to benefit from DoD investment in
high-priority systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations, and in the development of systems that meet evolving threats worldwide. We believe Aerojet
is also well positioned to support NASA through our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing work on both traditional and emerging launch vehicles.

High Visibility of Revenue with Multi-year Contracts and Sizable
Backlog

Significant Barriers to Entry 
Additionally, we benefit from significant customer funding of our research and development expenditures, which helps position us for long-term production contracts on products we develop. A substantial
portion of our business, including many of our contracts with major prime contractors to the U.S. government, the DoD, or NASA, also requires lengthy customer certification and qualification processes, which create significant obstacles for
potential competitors. As such, we are the sole provider on the vast majority of our contracts. In addition, new programs and platforms favor suppliers with extensive industry experience and a reputation for superior performance.
Indeed, the nature of these barriers is such that even firms established in one market niche find it difficult to enter an
adjacent market niche.

Exceptional Long-Term Industry Relationships

Competition
As the only domestic supplier of all four propulsion types  solid, liquid, air-breathing, and electric  we
believe that Aerojet is in a unique competitive position.
The nature of the markets in which Aerojet operates
varies. In some markets (especially in larger systems), the market is characterized by a few large, long-term programs, intermittent new program starts (with new buys spread further out in periods of declining budgets) and, therefore, relatively few
new competitive awards. In these markets there tend to be few participants each with longstanding legacy positions. Thus, as noted above, the bulk of Aerojets revenues is derived from sole source contracts where Aerojet is the long-term
incumbent.
In other markets, the dynamics can be different, with more numerous, but smaller awards and a
larger number of competitors. The basis on which Aerojet competes in the Aerospace and Defense industry varies by program, but generally is based upon technology, quality, service, and price. Although market competition in certain sectors can be
intense, we believe Aerojet possesses innovative and advanced propulsion and armament solutions, combined with adequate resources to continue to compete successfully.

Industry Overview
For the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ending September 30, 2012 and beyond, federal department/agency
budgets are expected to remain under severe pressure due to the financial impacts from spending cap agreements contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as from ongoing military operations and the cumulative effects of annual federal
budget deficits and rising U.S. federal debt. As a result, the DoD budget is expected to decrease by $21 billion for GFY 2012 relative to the Obama Administration (the Administration) requested level and by $46 billion in the GFY 2013
budget request to be submitted by the Administration in February 2012. The NASA budget will decline by $924 million for GFY 2012 relative to the Administrations requested level and is expected to decline slightly for GFY 2013.
Nevertheless, Aerojet is well-positioned to benefit from continued DoD investment in high priority transformational
systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations in the Middle East, and systems that meet new worldwide threats. The Administration has indicated a
commitment to maintain adequate, albeit lower levels of funding for the DoD than those experienced during the height of conflicts in the Middle East while building defense capabilities for the 21st century. Priority areas that impact our products
include: fully equipping U.S. forces for the missions they face; maintaining situational awareness; preserving air supremacy; maintaining forces at sea; ensuring access to and freedom of space; and developing pragmatic and cost effective missile
defense systems.
In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act (the Authorization Act) took effect impacting
GFYs 2011-2013. The Authorization Act aimed to: safely retire the Space Shuttle; extend the International Space Station through 2020; continue the development of the multipurpose crew exploration vehicle; build a new heavy lift launch vehicle;
invest in new space technologies; and sustain and grow the science and aeronautics programs at NASA. We are well-positioned to succeed among our competitors due to our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing contracts with both
traditional and emerging launch providers. Additionally, we are the main propulsion provider for the multipurpose crew vehicle and plan to compete for elements of the newly announced heavy lift launch vehicle. However, funding levels for both GFY
2011 and GFY 2012 were both below the authorized level, and we anticipate this trend continuing in GFY 2013.
As a part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 or, the Act (Public Law 112-25) (the debt-ceiling and
deficit-reduction compromise agreement signed into law on August 2, 2011), approximately $487 billion in defense spending cuts over the next ten years have been initiated in GFY 2012 appropriations measures and the GFY

Major Customers
As a merchant supplier to the Aerospace and Defense industry, we align ourselves with single prime contractors on a project-by-project basis. We believe that our position as a merchant supplier has helped
us become a trusted partner to our customers, enabling us to maintain strong, long-term relationships with a variety of prime contractors. Under each of our contracts, we act either as a prime contractor, where we sell directly to the end user, or
as a subcontractor, where we sell our products to other prime contractors. The principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government.

Space Systems 
Aerojets commitment to quality and excellence in
its space systems programs was reflected in its 100% success rate on its numerous space exploration, military and commercial missions during fiscal 2011. Among these were the final flight of the Space Shuttle program, the rescue of the Advanced
Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) military communications satellite, and perhaps best illustrating the reach of Aerojets Space product lines was the launch of NASAs Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). The MSL mission
relies on 48 different Aerojet propulsive elements ranging from four large solid boosters to the space craft landing thrusters and all the in-space propulsion that is required in between.
These continued space program successes strengthen our legacy of supplying mission critical propulsion systems to the DoD
and NASA as we have since the inception of the U.S. civil and military space programs and support our position as a critical supplier to our space systems customers.

Contract Types
Under each of its contracts, Aerojet acts either as a prime contractor, where it sells directly to the end user, or as a
subcontractor, selling its products to other prime contractors. Research and development contracts are awarded during the inception stage of a programs development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature
products for operational use. Aerojets contracts are primarily categorized as either fixed-price or cost-reimbursable. During fiscal 2011, approximately 53% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts, 41% from
cost-reimbursable contracts, and 6% from other sales including commercial contracts and real estate activities.
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price
level of effort contracts. For fixed-price contracts, Aerojet performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs of performance. For fixed-price-incentive contracts, Aerojet receives increased
or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the
customers labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in losses.
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet typically
receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet receives
adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule.
Many programs under contract have product life cycles exceeding ten years, such as the Atlas V, Standard Missile,
Hawk, TOW, and Tomahawk programs. It is typical for U.S. government propulsion contracts to be relatively small during development phases that can last from two to five years, followed by low-rate and then full-rate production, where annual
funding can grow significantly.

Government Contracts and Regulations
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), agency-specific
regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoDs Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to
government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractors failure to comply with these regulations and requirements
could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from
government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)
and other government agencies. These agencies review a contractors performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA and other government agencies also review the adequacy of, and a
contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and material management and accounting information systems.

Research and Development
We view research and development efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we
compete. We maintain an active research and development effort supported primarily by customer funding. We believe that some customer-funded research and development expenditures that are subject to contract specifications may become key programs in
the future. We believe customer-funded research and development activities are vital to our ability to compete for contracts and to enhance our technology base.
Aerojets company-funded research and development efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well
as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes.

Suppliers, Raw Materials and Seasonality
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances
beyond Aerojets control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to Aerojets program performance and cost.
Availability of raw materials and supplies to Aerojet has been generally sufficient. Aerojet is sometimes dependent, for a
variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and has, in some instances, in the past

Intellectual Property
Where appropriate, Aerojet
obtains patents and trademarks in the U.S. and other countries covering various aspects of the design and manufacture of its products. We rely on a combination of patents in targeted areas of technology relating to our business, along with
trade secret protections for other competitively-sensitive technologies and intellectual properties used in the business, to maintain our competitive edge in the markets in which we compete. We use patents selectively both (i) to protect
specific inventions whose characteristics and features would be obvious to competitors, such as mechanical designs or structures and (ii) to establish that we have made inventions in particular areas of relevant technologies and thus can
prevent competitors from claiming exclusive rights in those technologies through competing patents. A patent is maintained as long as the underlying invention has value in the market which we compete. A patented invention incorporated into a product
sold will typically be maintained to its explanation, approximately 20 years. We rely more extensively on trade secrets to protect specific inventions whose characteristics and features are not obvious to competitors, such as propellant formulations
or materials and manufacturing processes and procedures, to protect significant intellectual properties. Therefore, no single patent or group of patents is material to us, as we do not rely on patents alone to protect our intellectual property
rights that are the basis for our competitive posture. Trade secrets that are protected under applicable state and federal laws are maintained in perpetuity.

Additionally, we benefit from significant customer funding of our research and development expenditures, which helps position us for long-term production contracts on products we develop. A substantial
portion of our business, including many of our contracts with major prime contractors to the U.S. government, the DoD, or NASA, also requires lengthy customer certification and qualification processes, which create significant obstacles for
potential competitors. As such, we are the sole provider on the vast majority of our contracts. In addition, new programs and platforms favor suppliers with extensive industry experience and a reputation for superior performance.
Indeed, the nature of these barriers is such that even firms established in one market niche find it difficult to enter an

Competition
As the only domestic supplier of all four propulsion types  solid, liquid, air-breathing, and electric  we
believe that Aerojet is in a unique competitive position.
The nature of the markets in which Aerojet operates
varies. In some markets (especially in larger systems), the market is characterized by a few large, long-term programs, intermittent new program starts (with new buys spread further out in periods of declining budgets) and, therefore, relatively few
new competitive awards. In these markets there tend to be few participants each with longstanding legacy positions. Thus, as noted above, the bulk of Aerojets revenues is derived from sole source contracts where Aerojet is the long-term
incumbent.
In other markets, the dynamics can be different, with more numerous, but smaller awards and a
larger number of competitors. The basis on which Aerojet competes in the Aerospace and Defense industry varies by program, but generally is based upon technology, quality, service, and price. Although market competition in certain sectors can be
intense, we believe Aerojet possesses innovative and advanced propulsion and armament solutions, combined with adequate resources to continue to compete successfully.

Industry Overview
For the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ending September 30, 2012 and beyond, federal department/agency
budgets are expected to remain under severe pressure due to the financial impacts from spending cap agreements contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as from ongoing military operations and the cumulative effects of annual federal
budget deficits and rising U.S. federal debt. As a result, the DoD budget is expected to decrease by $21 billion for GFY 2012 relative to the Obama Administration (the Administration) requested level and by $46 billion in the GFY 2013
budget request to be submitted by the Administration in February 2012. The NASA budget will decline by $924 million for GFY 2012 relative to the Administrations requested level and is expected to decline slightly for GFY 2013.
Nevertheless, Aerojet is well-positioned to benefit from continued DoD investment in high priority transformational
systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations in the Middle East, and systems that meet new worldwide threats. The Administration has indicated a
commitment to maintain adequate, albeit lower levels of funding for the DoD than those experienced during the height of conflicts in the Middle East while building defense capabilities for the 21st century. Priority areas that impact our products
include: fully equipping U.S. forces for the missions they face; maintaining situational awareness; preserving air supremacy; maintaining forces at sea; ensuring access to and freedom of space; and developing pragmatic and cost effective missile
defense systems.
In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act (the Authorization Act) took effect impacting
GFYs 2011-2013. The Authorization Act aimed to: safely retire the Space Shuttle; extend the International Space Station through 2020; continue the development of the multipurpose crew exploration vehicle; build a new heavy lift launch vehicle;
invest in new space technologies; and sustain and grow the science and aeronautics programs at NASA. We are well-positioned to succeed among our competitors due to our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing contracts with both
traditional and emerging launch providers. Additionally, we are the main propulsion provider for the multipurpose crew vehicle and plan to compete for elements of the newly announced heavy lift launch vehicle. However, funding levels for both GFY
2011 and GFY 2012 were both below the authorized level, and we anticipate this trend continuing in GFY 2013.
As a part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 or, the Act (Public Law 112-25) (the debt-ceiling and
deficit-reduction compromise agreement signed into law on August 2, 2011), approximately $487 billion in defense spending cuts over the next ten years have been initiated in GFY 2012 appropriations measures and the GFY

subcontractor, selling its products to other prime contractors. Research and development contracts are awarded during the inception stage of a programs development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature
products for operational use. Aerojets contracts are primarily categorized as either fixed-price or cost-reimbursable. During fiscal 2011, approximately 53% of our net sales were from fixed-price contracts, 41% from
cost-reimbursable contracts, and 6% from other sales including commercial contracts and real estate activities.
Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price
level of effort contracts. For fixed-price contracts, Aerojet performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs of performance. For fixed-price-incentive contracts, Aerojet receives increased
or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed-price level of effort contracts, Aerojet generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the
customers labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in losses.
Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet typically
receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet receives
adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule.
Many programs under contract have product life cycles exceeding ten years, such as the Atlas V, Standard Missile,
Hawk, TOW, and Tomahawk programs. It is typical for U.S. government propulsion contracts to be relatively small during development phases that can last from two to five years, followed by low-rate and then full-rate production, where annual
funding can grow significantly.

Government Contracts and Regulations
U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), agency-specific
regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoDs Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to
government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractors failure to comply with these regulations and requirements
could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from
government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)
and other government agencies. These agencies review a contractors performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA and other government agencies also review the adequacy of, and a
contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and material management and accounting information systems.

Research and Development
We view research and development efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we
compete. We maintain an active research and development effort supported primarily by customer funding. We believe that some customer-funded research and development expenditures that are subject to contract specifications may become key programs in
the future. We believe customer-funded research and development activities are vital to our ability to compete for contracts and to enhance our technology base.
Aerojets company-funded research and development efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well
as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes.

Suppliers, Raw Materials and Seasonality
The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances
beyond Aerojets control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to Aerojets program performance and cost.
Availability of raw materials and supplies to Aerojet has been generally sufficient. Aerojet is sometimes dependent, for a
variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and has, in some instances, in the past

Intellectual Property
Where appropriate, Aerojet
obtains patents and trademarks in the U.S. and other countries covering various aspects of the design and manufacture of its products. We rely on a combination of patents in targeted areas of technology relating to our business, along with
trade secret protections for other competitively-sensitive technologies and intellectual properties used in the business, to maintain our competitive edge in the markets in which we compete. We use patents selectively both (i) to protect
specific inventions whose characteristics and features would be obvious to competitors, such as mechanical designs or structures and (ii) to establish that we have made inventions in particular areas of relevant technologies and thus can
prevent competitors from claiming exclusive rights in those technologies through competing patents. A patent is maintained as long as the underlying invention has value in the market which we compete. A patented invention incorporated into a product
sold will typically be maintained to its explanation, approximately 20 years. We rely more extensively on trade secrets to protect specific inventions whose characteristics and features are not obvious to competitors, such as propellant formulations
or materials and manufacturing processes and procedures, to protect significant intellectual properties. Therefore, no single patent or group of patents is material to us, as we do not rely on patents alone to protect our intellectual property
rights that are the basis for our competitive posture. Trade secrets that are protected under applicable state and federal laws are maintained in perpetuity.

Business/Real Estate","Real Estate
We own approximately 12,200 acres of land
in the Sacramento metropolitan area which we refer to as the Sacramento Land. Acquired in the early 1950s for our aerospace and defense operations, there were large portions used solely to provide safe buffer zones. Modern changes in propulsion
technology coupled with the relocation of certain of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to reposition this excess Sacramento Land,
re-entitle it for new uses, and explore various opportunities to optimize its value.

The environmentally restricted acreage described above is subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our
historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been
accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 7(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land.
(2)
The term entitled is generally used to denote the set of local regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested
uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each land zoning proposal and may include permits, general plan amendments, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals
unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and others prior to construction.
(3)
The term limited entitlements is generally used to denote where a project receives a portion, but not all of the set of regulatory
approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested uses, as described in Note 2, above.
(4)
We believe that the operations land is more than adequate for our long-term needs. As we reassess needs in the future, portions of this land may
become available for entitlement.
(5)
We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess
land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time.

Leasing & Other Real Estate
We currently lease approximately 303,000 square feet of office space in Sacramento to various third parties. These
leasing activities generated $6.7 million in revenue in fiscal 2011.
We also own approximately
580 acres of land in Chino Hills, California. This property was used for the manufacture and testing of ordnance. With the sale of our ordnance business in the mid-1990s, we closed this facility and commenced clean-up of the site. We continue
to work with state regulators and the City of Chino Hills to complete those efforts. Once the remediation is complete, we will assess options and work to maximize the value of the property.

Business/Environmental Matters","Environmental Matters
Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign
environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and
protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a
normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop.
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered.
Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures
eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million. Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs associated with
Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of operations.
Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. See additional information below.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of the
Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):

Risk Factors","Item 1A.
Risk Factors
Item 1A.
Risk Factors

The cancellation or material modification of one or more significant contracts could adversely affect our financial results.
Sales, directly and indirectly, to the U.S. government and its agencies accounted for approximately 93% of our total
net sales in fiscal 2011. Our contracts typically permit the U.S. government to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time. The cancellation of one or more significant contracts and/or
programs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize anticipated sales and profits. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government
in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed, and our profit would be limited to work completed prior to termination.

Future reductions or changes in U.S. government spending could adversely affect our financial results.
Our primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD, and its agencies, the government prime
contractors that supply products to these customers, and NASA. As a result, we rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense and space applications and armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems
and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in a large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These spending levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but
rather follow the cycle of general political support for this

Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S.
government.
U.S. government agencies, including the DCAA and various agency Inspectors General,
routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractors performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The U.S. government also reviews
the adequacy of, and a contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, accounting, and information systems. Any costs found to
be misclassified may be subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of
profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.

If we experience cost overruns on our contracts, we would have to absorb the excess costs which could adversely
affect our financial results and our ability to win new contracts.
In fiscal 2011, approximately 53%
of our net sales was from fixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a fixed price and realize all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in the costs of performing the contract. As a result,
all fixed-price contracts involve the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. To the extent we were to incur unanticipated cost overruns on a program or platform subject to a fixed-price contract, our profitability would be adversely affected.
Future profitability is subject to risks including the ability of suppliers to deliver components of acceptable quality on schedule and the successful implementation of automated tooling in production processes.
In fiscal 2011, approximately 41% of our net sales was from cost reimbursable contracts. Under cost reimbursable
contracts, we agree to be reimbursed for allowable costs and be paid a fee. If our costs are in excess of the final target cost, fees and our margin may be adversely affected. If our costs exceed authorized contract funding or they do not qualify as
allowable costs under applicable regulations, we will not be reimbursed for those costs. Cost overruns may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.

If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual
obligations, our contract performance and our ability to win new contracts may be adversely affected.
We rely on subcontractors to perform a portion of the services we agree to provide our customers and on suppliers to
provide raw materials and component parts for our contract performance. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon services or supplies may affect our ability to perform
our contractual obligations. Deficiencies in the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers could result in our customer terminating our contract for default. A termination for default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our
financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.

Our success and growth in our Aerospace and
Defense segment depends on our ability to execute longstanding programs and periodically secure new contracts.
Aerojets revenue is primarily derived form longstanding contracts (often sole source) where Aerojet is the long-term incumbent. The challenge for Aerojet is to utilize its technical, engineering,
manufacturing and management skills to execute these programs well for the customer, to continue to innovate and refine its solutions, and to offer the customer increasing affordability in an era of fiscal restraint. Aeroject has a history of
continuing to innovate even while operating in a sole source environment.
In sectors where there is
competition, it can be intense. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, production, and other resources substantially greater than ours. Although the downsizing of the defense industry in the early 1990s resulted in a reduction in the
aggregate number of competitors, the consolidation has also strengthened the capabilities of some of the remaining competitors. The U.S. government also has its own manufacturing capabilities in some areas. We may be unable to compete successfully
with our competitors and our inability to do so could result in a decrease in sales, profits, and cash flows that we historically have generated from certain contracts. Further, the U.S. government may open to competition programs on which we are
currently the sole supplier, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Our Aerospace and Defense segment is subject to procurement and other related laws and regulations inherent in contracting with the U.S. government, non-compliance with which could adversely affect
our financial results.
In the performance of contracts with the U.S. government, we are subject
to complex and extensive procurement and other related laws and regulations. Possible consequences of a failure to comply, even inadvertently, with these laws and regulations include civil and criminal fines and penalties including, in some cases,
double or triple damages, and suspension or debarment from future government contracts and exporting of goods for a specified period of time.
These laws and regulations provide for ongoing audits and reviews of incurred costs as well as contract procurement, performance and administration. The U.S. government may, if it deems appropriate,
conduct an investigation into possible illegal or unethical activity in connection with these contracts. Investigations of this nature are common in the aerospace and defense industry, and lawsuits may result. In addition, the U.S. government
and its principal prime contractors periodically investigate the financial viability of its contractors and subcontractors as part of its risk assessment process associated with the award of new contracts. If the U.S. government or one or more
prime contractors were to determine that we were not financially viable, our ability to continue to act as a government contractor or subcontractor would be impaired.

We may expand our operations through acquisitions, which may divert managements attention and expose us to
unanticipated liabilities and costs. Also, acquisitions may increase our non-reimbursable costs. We may experience difficulties integrating any acquired operations, and we may incur costs relating to acquisitions that are never consummated.
Our business strategy may lead us to expand our Aerospace and Defense segment through acquisitions.
However, our ability to consummate any future acquisitions on terms that are favorable to us may be limited by government regulations, the nu mber of attractive acquisition targets, internal demands on our resources, and our ability to obtain
financing. Our success in integrating newly acquired businesses will depend upon our ability to

Our inability to adapt to rapid technological changes could impair our ability to remain competitive.
The aerospace and defense industry continues to undergo rapid and significant technological
development. Our competitors may implement new technologies before us, allowing them to provide more effective products at more competitive prices. Future technological developments could:

adversely impact our competitive position if we are unable to react to these developments in a timely or efficient manner;

require us to write-down obsolete facilities, equipment, and technology;

require us to discontinue production of obsolete products before we can recover any or all of our related research, development and
commercialization expenses; or

require significant capital expenditures for research, development, and launch of new products or processes.

Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology
infrastructure.
We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology
hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. We are constantly updating our information technology infrastructure. Any failure to manage, expand and update our
information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business.
Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other similar disruptions. Any
system failure, successful cyber-attack, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, inappropriate disclosure of
confidential information, or negative publicity, it could harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.

Our implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may adversely affect our
business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
In fiscal 2011, we began implementing a new ERP system that will deliver a new generation of information systems and work
processes. ERP implementations are complex and very time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that take several years. If we do not effectively implement the ERP system or if
the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect financial reporting systems, our ability to produce financial reports, and/or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

We may experience warranty claims for product failures, schedule
delays or other problems with existing or new products and systems.
Many of the products we develop
and manufacture are technologically advanced systems that must function under demanding operating conditions. Even though we believe that we employ sophisticated and rigorous design, manufacturing and testing processes and practices, we may not be
able to successfully launch or manufacture our products on schedule or our products may not perform as intended.
If our products fail to perform adequately, some of our contracts require us to forfeit a portion of our expected profit,
receive reduced payments, provide a replacement product or service or reduce the price of subsequent sales to the same customer. Performance penalties may also be imposed if we fail to meet delivery schedules or other measures of contract
performance. We do not generally insure against potential costs resulting from any required remedial actions or costs or loss of sales due to postponement or cancellation of scheduled operations or product deliveries.

The release or explosion of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt our operations and could
adversely affect our financial results.
Our business operations involve the handling and production of
potentially explosive materials and other dangerous chemicals, including materials used in rocket propulsion and explosive devices. Despite our use of specialized facilities to handle dangerous materials and intensive employee training programs, the
handling and production of hazardous materials could result in incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our manufacturing operations and could cause production delays. It is possible that a release of these chemicals or an explosion
could result in death or significant injuries to employees and others. Material property damage to us and third parties could also occur. The use of these products in applications by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion or
fire were to occur. Any release or explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages or cause production delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

Disruptions in the supply of key raw materials, difficulties in the supplier qualification
process or increases in prices of raw materials could adversely affect our financial results.
We use a
significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous
customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. We are often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain
the supply. To date we have been successful in establishing replacement materials and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that
supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry and actual pricing is based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price
increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and
appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
We are also
impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. We continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity
metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to negotiate with our customers for economic and/or
price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain
strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms,
increasing the cost risk to our programs.

Our pension plan is currently underfunded and we expect to be required to
make cash contributions in future periods, which may reduce the cash available for our businesses.
As
of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, our total defined benefit pension plan assets, total projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation for our qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4
million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA) requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified
measurement dates. Our funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% funding target ratio required under the PPA. The required funded ratio to be met as
of the November 30, 2011 measurement date is 100%. While the final calculated PPA funded ratio as of November 30, 2011 is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012, we do not anticipate meeting the 100% requirement which could
trigger funding requirements in the future, but not prior to 2013, which is the earliest possible date funding would be required. We do not expect to make significant contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2012. See
additional discussion at Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have accumulated $59.5
million in prepayment credits as of November 30, 2011. Companies may prepay contributions and, under certain circumstances, use those prepayment credits to satisfy the required funding of the pension plans annual required contribution
thereby allowing companies to defer cash payments into the pension plan.
Further, with the Office of Federal
Procurement Policy issuance of the final rule harmonizing Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 412,
Composition and Measurement of Pension Cost , and CAS 413,
Adjustment and Allocation of Pension Cost  with the PPA, on
December 27, 2011, we expect to recover portions of any required pension funding through our government contracts on a more favorable basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of the harmonization of CAS 412 and CAS 413 on our financial
statements.
The funded status of the pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of
the plans assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plans
assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plan could be higher
than we expect. In addition, changes to the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities could adversely affect the funded status of the plan.

The level of returns on retirement benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates, changes in legislation, and other factors affects our financial results.
Our earnings are positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee
retirement benefit plans. We calculate the expense for the plans based on actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions that we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators
result in changes in the assumptions we use. The key assumptions used to estimate retirement benefit plan expense for the following year are the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our pension expense or income can
also be affected by legislation and other government regulatory actions.

Our operations and properties are currently the subject of significant
environmental liabilities, and the numerous environmental and other government requirements to which we are subject may become more stringent in the future.
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that, among other things, require us to obtain permits to
operate and install pollution control equipment and regulate the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. These requirements may become more stringent in the future. Additional regulations
dictate how and to what level we remediate contaminated soils and the level to which we are required to clean contaminated groundwater. These requirements may also become more stringent in the future. We may also be subject to fines and penalties
relating to the operation of our existing and formerly owned businesses. We have been and are subject to toxic tort and asbestos lawsuits as well as other third-party lawsuits, due to either our past or present use of hazardous substances or the
alleged on-site or off-site contamination of the environment through past or present operations. We may incur material costs in defending these claims and lawsuits and any similar claims and lawsuits that may arise in the future. Contamination at
our current and former properties is subject to investigation and remediation requirements under federal, state and local laws and regulations, and the full extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Any adverse judgment or cash
outlay could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Although some of our environmental costs may be recoverable and we have established reserves, given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may
not be sufficient, which could adversely affect our financial results.
As of November 30, 2011,
the aggregate range of our environmental costs was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million, of which $181.4 million relates to Aerojet sites and $9.2 million relates to non-Aerojet sites.
We believe the accrued amount for future remediation costs represents the costs that could be incurred by us over the contractual term, if any, or the next fifteen years of the estimated remediation, to the extent they are probable and reasonably
estimable. However, in many cases the nature and extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient. We
evaluate the adequacy of those reserves on a quarterly basis, and they could change. In addition, the reserves are based only on known sites and the known contamination at those sites. It is possible that additional sites needing remediation may be
identified or that unknown contamination at previously identified sites may be discovered. It is also possible that the regulatory agencies may change clean-up standards for chemicals of concern such as ammonium perchlorate and trichloroethylene.
This could lead to additional expenditures for environmental remediation in the future and, given the uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient.
Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are
allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the
consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of
operations. However, we are seeking to amend our agreement with the U.S. government to increase the amount allocable to U.S. government contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this pursuit.
Our environmental expenses related to non-Aerojet sites are generally not recoverable and a significant increase in these
estimated environmental expenses could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

We are from time to time subject to significant litigation, the
outcome of which could adversely affect our financial results.
We and our subsidiaries are subject to
material litigation. We may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be very costly and can divert managements efforts. Adverse outcomes in litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

We face certain
significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance.
A significant portion of our business relates to developing and manufacturing propulsion systems for defense and space applications, armament systems for precision tactical weapon systems and munitions
applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the
U.S. government. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and
liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Our inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses prospects
and competitive positions.
We seek to protect proprietary technology and inventions through patents
and other proprietary-right protection. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary rights. In addition, we may incur significant expense in protecting our
intellectual property.
We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological
innovation to remain competitive. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors. These agreements may be breached and remedies
for a breach may not be sufficient to compensate us for damages incurred. We generally control and limit access to our product documentation and other proprietary information. Other parties may independently develop our know-how or
otherwise obtain access to our technology.

Business disruptions could seriously affect us.
Our business may be affected by disruptions including, but not limited to: threats to physical
security of our facilities and employees, including senior executives; terrorist acts; information technology attacks or failures; damaging weather or other acts of nature; and pandemics or other public health crises. The costs related to these
events may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. Disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

If our operating subsidiaries do not generate sufficient cash flow or if they are not able to
pay dividends or otherwise distribute their cash to us, or if we have insufficient funds on hand, we may not be able to service our debt.
All of the operations of our Aerospace and Defense and Real Estate segments are conducted through subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and ability to service our debt obligations will be largely
dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of our operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these subsidiaries to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or
make other payments or advances to us will depend upon their operating results and cash flows and will be subject to applicable laws and any contractual restrictions contained in the agreements governing their debt, if any.

We have a substantial amount of debt. Our ability to operate is
limited by the agreements governing our debt.
We have a substantial amount of debt for which we are
required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of November 30, 2011, we had $326.4 million of debt. Subject to the limits contained
in some of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, we may incur additional debt in the future.
Our
level of debt places significant demands on our cash resources, which could:

make it more difficult to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations;

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash for payments related to our debt, reducing the amount of cash flow available for working
capital, capital expenditures, entitlement of our real estate assets, and other general corporate purposes;

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete;

place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial
resources than we do;

limit our ability to borrow additional funds;

limit our ability to expand our operations through acquisitions; and

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.
If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and fund our operating costs, our liquidity may be
adversely affected.

We are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants
outlined in our debt indentures and agreements that could restrict our operating activities. A failure to comply could result in a default under our second amended and restated credit agreement (the Senior Credit Facility) which would,
if not waived by the lenders which likely would come with substantial cost, accelerate the payment of our debt. A payment default under the Senior Credit Facility could result in cross defaults on our 9 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes (9 1/2% Notes), and 4.0625% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures (4 1/16% Debentures).

Our debt instruments generally contain various restrictive covenants which
include, among others, provisions which may restrict our ability to:

access the full amount of our revolving credit facility and/or incur additional debt;

enter into certain leases;

make certain distributions, investments, and other restricted payments;

cause our restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us;

enter into transactions with affiliates;

create certain liens;

purchase assets or businesses;

sell assets and, if sold, retain excess cash flow from these sales; and

consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
Our secured debt also contains other customary covenants, including, among others, provisions:

relating to the maintenance of the property collateralizing the debt; and

restricting our ability to pledge assets or create other liens.

The real estate market is inherently risky, which could adversely affect our financial results.
Our real estate activities involve significant risks, which could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject
to various risks, including the following:

we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary re-zoning, land use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental
permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects;

we may be unable to complete environmental remediation or to have state and federal environmental restrictions on our property lifted, which could
cause a delay or abandonment of these projects;

we may be unable to obtain sufficient water sources to service our projects, which may prevent us from executing our plans;

our real estate activities require significant expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, which may render us
unable to proceed with our plans;

economic and political uncertainties could have an adverse effect on consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials
and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general;

our property is subject to federal, state, and local regulations and restrictions that may impose significant limitations on our plans;

much of our property is raw land that includes the natural habitats of various endangered or protected wildlife species requiring mitigation;

if our land use plans are approved by the appropriate governmental authorities, we may face lawsuits from those who oppose such plans. Such lawsuits
and the costs associated with such opposition could be material and have an adverse effect on our ability to sell property or realize income from our projects; and

the time frame required for approval of our plans means that we will have to wait years for a significant cash return.

Substantially all of our excess real estate, that we are in the
process of entitling for new opportunities, is located in Sacramento County, California making us vulnerable to changes in economic and other conditions in that particular market.
As a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, our long-term real estate performance and the value of our
properties will depend upon conditions in the Sacramento region, including:

the sustainability and growth of industries located in the Sacramento region;

the financial strength and spending of the State of California;

local real estate market conditions;

changes in neighborhood characteristics;

changes in interest rates; and

real estate tax rates.
If unfavorable economic or other conditions continue in the region, our plans and business strategy could be adversely affected.

We may incur additional costs related to divestitures, which could adversely affect our financial results.
In connection with our divestitures of the Fine Chemicals and GDX Automotive businesses in fiscal 2005
and fiscal 2004, respectively, we have incurred and may incur additional costs, including costs related to the closure of a manufacturing facility in Chartres, France. As part of these and other divestitures, we have provided customary
indemnification to the purchasers for such matters as claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, including warranty and income tax matters, and liability to investigate and remediate certain environmental contamination
existing prior to disposition. These additional costs and the indemnification of the purchasers of our former businesses may require additional cash expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

In order to be successful, we must attract and retain key employees.
Our business has a continuing need to attract large numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel
holding security clearances, to support the growth of the enterprise and to replace individuals who have terminated employment due to retirement or for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could
experience higher labor, recruiting, or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet. In addition, our inability to
appropriately plan for the transfer or replacement of appropriate intellectual capital and skill sets critical to us could result in business disruptions and impair our ability to achieve business objectives.

A strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms,
could adversely affect our financial results.
As of November 30, 2011, 12% of our
3,268 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In June 2011, we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with substantially all of our covered employees through June 2014. In the future, if we are unable to
negotiate acceptable new agreements with the unions, upon expiration of the existing contracts, we could experience a strike or work stoppage. Even if we are successful in negotiating new agreements, the new agreements could call for higher wages or
benefits paid to union members, which would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our profitability. If our unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other non-unionized operations were to become
unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities or higher ongoing labor costs. A strike or other work stoppage in the facilities of any of our major customers or suppliers could also have similar effects on
us.

Due to the nature of our business, our sales levels may fluctuate
causing our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.
Changes in our operating results from quarter to
quarter may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock. Our quarterly and annual sales are affected by a variety of factors that may lead to significant variability in our operating results. In our Aerospace and Defense segment,
sales earned under long-term contracts are recognized either on a cost basis, when deliveries are made, or when contractually defined performance milestones are achieved. The timing of deliveries or milestones may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
In our Real Estate segment, sales of property may be made from time to time, which may result in variability in our operating results and cash flows.

We use estimates in accounting for most of our programs. Changes in our estimates could affect our future financial results.
Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract sales and costs, and making
assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made
regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impacts of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction
efforts. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Estimates of award and
incentive fees are also used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be
recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may adversely affect our future period operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

New accounting standards could result in changes to our methods of quantifying and recording
accounting transactions, and could affect our financial results.
Changes to generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America arise from new and revised standards, interpretations, the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, and other guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and others. On December 27, 2011, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued its final rule harmonizing CAS 412,
Composition
and Measurement of Pension Cost , and CAS 413,
Adjustment and Allocation of Pension Cost  with the PPA. We are currently evaluating the impact of the harmonization of CAS 412 and CAS 413 on our financial statements. Further, our current
Forward Pricing Rates (FPRs) did not yet reflect the full effect of the PPA and harmonized CAS 412 and 413 requirements at November 30, 2011. The PPA and harmonized CAS 412 and 413 funding requirements are expected to be
incorporated into our FPRs in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

Failure to maintain effective internal
controls in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Out of period adjustments could require us to restate or revise previously issued financial statements.
Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to
effectively prevent fraud. We rely on numerous manual processes to manage our business, which increases our risk of having an internal control failure. The SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules
requiring public companies to include a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on Form 10-K. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must report on
the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Although we review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, if we or our independent registered public
accounting firm is not satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if our

Sales, directly and indirectly, to the U.S. government and its agencies accounted for approximately 93% of our total
net sales in fiscal 2011. Our contracts typically permit the U.S. government to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time. The cancellation of one or more significant contracts and/or
programs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize anticipated sales and profits. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government
in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed, and our profit would be limited to work completed prior to termination.

U.S. government agencies, including the DCAA and various agency Inspectors General,
routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractors performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The U.S. government also reviews
the adequacy of, and a contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, accounting, and information systems. Any costs found to
be misclassified may be subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of
profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.

affect our financial results and our ability to win new contracts.
In fiscal 2011, approximately 53%
of our net sales was from fixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a fixed price and realize all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in the costs of performing the contract. As a result,
all fixed-price contracts involve the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. To the extent we were to incur unanticipated cost overruns on a program or platform subject to a fixed-price contract, our profitability would be adversely affected.
Future profitability is subject to risks including the ability of suppliers to deliver components of acceptable quality on schedule and the successful implementation of automated tooling in production processes.
In fiscal 2011, approximately 41% of our net sales was from cost reimbursable contracts. Under cost reimbursable
contracts, we agree to be reimbursed for allowable costs and be paid a fee. If our costs are in excess of the final target cost, fees and our margin may be adversely affected. If our costs exceed authorized contract funding or they do not qualify as
allowable costs under applicable regulations, we will not be reimbursed for those costs. Cost overruns may adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to win new contracts.

Defense segment depends on our ability to execute longstanding programs and periodically secure new contracts.
Aerojets revenue is primarily derived form longstanding contracts (often sole source) where Aerojet is the long-term incumbent. The challenge for Aerojet is to utilize its technical, engineering,
manufacturing and management skills to execute these programs well for the customer, to continue to innovate and refine its solutions, and to offer the customer increasing affordability in an era of fiscal restraint. Aeroject has a history of
continuing to innovate even while operating in a sole source environment.
In sectors where there is
competition, it can be intense. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, production, and other resources substantially greater than ours. Although the downsizing of the defense industry in the early 1990s resulted in a reduction in the

double or triple damages, and suspension or debarment from future government contracts and exporting of goods for a specified period of time.
These laws and regulations provide for ongoing audits and reviews of incurred costs as well as contract procurement, performance and administration. The U.S. government may, if it deems appropriate,
conduct an investigation into possible illegal or unethical activity in connection with these contracts. Investigations of this nature are common in the aerospace and defense industry, and lawsuits may result. In addition, the U.S. government

process or increases in prices of raw materials could adversely affect our financial results.
We use a
significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous
customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. We are often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain
the supply. To date we have been successful in establishing replacement materials and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that
supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry and actual pricing is based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price
increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and
appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
We are also
impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. We continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity
metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to negotiate with our customers for economic and/or
price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain
strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms,
increasing the cost risk to our programs.

make cash contributions in future periods, which may reduce the cash available for our businesses.
As
of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, our total defined benefit pension plan assets, total projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation for our qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4
million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA) requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified
measurement dates. Our funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% funding target ratio required under the PPA. The required funded ratio to be met as
of the November 30, 2011 measurement date is 100%. While the final calculated PPA funded ratio as of November 30, 2011 is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012, we do not anticipate meeting the 100% requirement which could
trigger funding requirements in the future, but not prior to 2013, which is the earliest possible date funding would be required. We do not expect to make significant contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2012. See
additional discussion at Note 6 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We have accumulated $59.5
million in prepayment credits as of November 30, 2011. Companies may prepay contributions and, under certain circumstances, use those prepayment credits to satisfy the required funding of the pension plans annual required contribution
thereby allowing companies to defer cash payments into the pension plan.
Further, with the Office of Federal
Procurement Policy issuance of the final rule harmonizing Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) 412,
Composition and Measurement of Pension Cost , and CAS 413,
Adjustment and Allocation of Pension Cost  with the PPA, on
December 27, 2011, we expect to recover portions of any required pension funding through our government contracts on a more favorable basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of the harmonization of CAS 412 and CAS 413 on our financial
statements.
The funded status of the pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of
the plans assets, by any changes in U.S. law and by changes in the statutory interest rates used by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements. Accordingly, if the performance of our plans
assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the Internal Revenue Service regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future contributions to our underfunded pension plan could be higher
than we expect. In addition, changes to the discount rate used to measure pension liabilities could adversely affect the funded status of the plan.

not be sufficient, which could adversely affect our financial results.
As of November 30, 2011,
the aggregate range of our environmental costs was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million, of which $181.4 million relates to Aerojet sites and $9.2 million relates to non-Aerojet sites.
We believe the accrued amount for future remediation costs represents the costs that could be incurred by us over the contractual term, if any, or the next fifteen years of the estimated remediation, to the extent they are probable and reasonably
estimable. However, in many cases the nature and extent of the required remediation has not yet been determined. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient. We
evaluate the adequacy of those reserves on a quarterly basis, and they could change. In addition, the reserves are based only on known sites and the known contamination at those sites. It is possible that additional sites needing remediation may be
identified or that unknown contamination at previously identified sites may be discovered. It is also possible that the regulatory agencies may change clean-up standards for chemicals of concern such as ammonium perchlorate and trichloroethylene.
This could lead to additional expenditures for environmental remediation in the future and, given the uncertainties involved in assessing liability for environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient.
Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are
allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the
consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of
operations. However, we are seeking to amend our agreement with the U.S. government to increase the amount allocable to U.S. government contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this pursuit.
Our environmental expenses related to non-Aerojet sites are generally not recoverable and a significant increase in these

incentive fees are also used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be

Risk Factors/New accounting standards could result in changes to our methods of quantifying and recording
accounting transactions, and could affect our financial results.","New accounting standards could result in changes to our methods of quantifying and recording
accounting transactions, and could affect our financial results.
Changes to generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America arise from new and revised standards, interpretations, the potential requirement that U.S. registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, and other guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and others. On December 27, 2011, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued its final rule harmonizing CAS 412,
Composition
and Measurement of Pension Cost , and CAS 413,
Adjustment and Allocation of Pension Cost  with the PPA. We are currently evaluating the impact of the harmonization of CAS 412 and CAS 413 on our financial statements. Further, our current
Forward Pricing Rates (FPRs) did not yet reflect the full effect of the PPA and harmonized CAS 412 and 413 requirements at November 30, 2011. The PPA and harmonized CAS 412 and 413 funding requirements are expected to be
incorporated into our FPRs in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to

Groundwater Cases

South El Monte Operable Unit (SEMOU) Related Cases
In October 2002, Aerojet and approximately 65 other individual and corporate defendants were served with four civil suits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that
sought recovery of costs allegedly incurred or to be incurred in response to the contamination present at the South El Monte Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund site. The plaintiffs claims against Aerojet were based upon
allegations of discharges from a former site in the El Monte area. Aerojet investigations did not identify a credible connection between the contaminants identified by the plaintiff water entities in the SEMOU and those detected at Aerojets
former facility located in El Monte, California, near the SEMOU (East Flair Drive site). The cases served on October 30, 2002 were denominated as follows:

San Gabriel Valley Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority v. Aerojet-General
Corporation, et al.

Southern California Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

The City of Monterey Park v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et
al.
The contamination in the
SEMOU was also subject to a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) naming Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to conduct the remedial design and
remedial action in the SEMOU.
These cases have been settled. Under the settlement, the Water Entities released
Aerojet and the Company from liability for all groundwater contamination in the geographic confines of the SEMOU alleged to have originated from the East Flair Drive site. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court approved and entered a
partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) which also resolved Aerojets liability under the UAO. On August 25, 2011, the Court granted Aerojets motion
for good faith settlement conditioned upon the payment by Aerojet of its second settlement payment on or before December 5, 2011. The Courts approval removes any contribution claims against Aerojet by other defendants. Aerojet paid the
second settlement payment on December 5, 2011 and the Courts Order took effect on December 8, 2011.

Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA)
On July 1, 2009, the County of Sacramento (County) and SCWA filed a complaint against Aerojet and Boeing
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento,
County of Sacramento; Sacramento County Water Agency v. Aerojet-General Corporation and The Boeing Corporation [sic],  Civ. No. 2:09-at-1041. In the
complaint, the County and SCWA alleged that because groundwater contamination from various sources including Aerojet, McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), and the former Mather Air Force Base, was continuing, the County and SCWA
should be awarded unspecified monetary damages as well as declaratory and equitable relief. Aerojet, Boeing, the County and SCWA reached a final settlement effective October 31, 2011 and Aerojets payment obligations under the settlement
were fully satisfied in fiscal 2011. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable (See Note 7(c) and (d) of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Sun Ridge LLC, et al. v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.
In December 2011, Aerojet received notice of a lawsuit styled
Sun Ridge LLC, et al. v.
Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.,  Case No. 34-2011-00114675, filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The complaint, which also names McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), was filed by owners of properties
adjacent to the Aerojet property in Rancho Cordova, California and alleges damages attributable to contamination of groundwater including diminution of property value and increased costs associated with ensuring water supplies in connection with the
real estate development. Aerojet has not been served with the complaint and is reviewing the allegations contained therein. In the event the lawsuit is served on Aerojet, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. Since this matter is in
the early stages, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what the outcome of this complaint will be. Accordingly, no estimate of liability has been accrued for this matter at November 30, 2011.

Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment Claim
The Company previously manufactured products for the automotive industry at a Toledo, Ohio site, which was adjacent to the
Ottawa River. This facility was divested in 1990 and the Company indemnified the buyer for claims and liabilities arising out of certain pre-divestiture environmental matters. In August 2007, the Company, along with numerous other companies,
received from the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service a notice of a NRD Assessment Plan for the Ottawa River and Northern Maumee Bay. A group of PRPs, including the Company, was formed to respond to the NRD assessment and
to pursue funding from the Great Lakes Legacy Act for primary restoration. The restoration project performed by the group consisted of river dredging and land-filling river sediments with a total project cost in the range of approximately $47 to $49
million, one half of which was funded through the Great Lakes Legacy Act and the net project costs to the PRP group was estimated at $23.5 to $24.5 million. The dredging of the river that began in December 2009 has been completed. In February 2011,
the parties reached an agreement on allocation. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of the Companys share of anticipated costs for the NRD matter was $2.1 million to $3.9 million and the accrued amount was $2.1 million which is
included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable. Still unresolved at this time is the actual NRD Assessment itself. It is not possible to predict the outcome,
timing, or the financial impact of these types of assessments, which are typically long processes lasting several years.

Textileather,
Inc. (Textileather)
In 2008, Textileather, the current owner of the former Toledo, Ohio site,
filed a lawsuit against the Company claiming, among other things, that the Company failed to indemnify and defend Textileather for certain contractual environmental obligations. A second suit related to past and future Resource Conservation Recovery
Act (RCRA) closure costs was filed in late 2009. On May 5, 2010, the District Court granted the Companys Motion for Summary Judgment, thereby dismissing the claims in the initial action. Textileather has appealed to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals. Briefs have been filed and oral argument is scheduled for March 2, 2012. There are no District Court ordered dates in the second Textileather suit, but the parties are conducting informal discovery. As of
November 30, 2011, the estimated anticipated costs and accrued amount for the Textileather matter was $2.1 million which is included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter
are recoverable.

Asbestos Litigation
The Company has been, and continues to be, named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury or death due to exposure to asbestos in building materials, products, or in manufacturing operations.
The majority of cases are pending in Texas and Pennsylvania. There were 146 asbestos cases pending as of November 30, 2011.
Given the lack of any significant consistency to claims (i.e., as to product, operational site, or other relevant assertions) filed against the Company, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate
of the future costs of pending claims or unasserted claims. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for such contingencies.

Subpoenas Duces Tecum
On November 23, 2011, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aerojet, entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney in Sacramento, California, acting on behalf of the U.S. of
America, in connection with a subpoena the Company received on January 6, 2010 relating to the allowability of certain costs under its U.S. Government-related prime and subcontracts. In connection with the settlement, the Company paid $3.3
million in fiscal 2011 and agreed not to seek reimbursement for the costs of the investigation and defense of this issue. The investigation focused on certain corporate costs incurred with respect to proxy expenses in 2004 and 2006. The Company
cooperated fully with the investigation.
On September 23, 2010, the Company received a subpoena duces
tecum from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, acting on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General of the DoD, requesting that the Company produce a variety of documents pertaining to the use of certain cost estimating factors under
its contracts with the DoD. The investigation is still in the early stages and no financial demand has been made; accordingly, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what the outcome of this civil investigation will be or the impact,
if any, the investigation may have on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for at November 30, 2011. The Company has and continues to
cooperate fully with the investigation and is responding to the subpoena.

Snappon SA Wrongful Discharge Claims
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a manufacturing facility in Chartres, France owned by Snappon SA, a
subsidiary of the Company, previously involved in the automotive business. In accordance with French law, Snappon SA negotiated with the local works council regarding the implementation of a social plan for the employees. Following the
implementation of the social plan, approximately 188 of the 249 former Snappon employees sued Snappon SA in the Chartres Labour Court alleging wrongful discharge. The claims were heard in two groups. On February 19, 2009, the Versailles Court
of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 2 plaintiffs and based on this, the Court awarded 1.9 million plus interest. On April 7, 2009, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 1 plaintiffs and based on
this, the Court awarded 1.0 million plus interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the Paris Commercial Court, and the claims will
likely be discharged through those proceedings. The Company has accrued a loss contingency of 2.9 million plus interest for this matter.

included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable. Still unresolved at this time is the actual NRD Assessment itself. It is not possible to predict the outcome,
timing, or the financial impact of these types of assessments, which are typically long processes lasting several years.

Textileather,
Inc. (Textileather)
In 2008, Textileather, the current owner of the former Toledo, Ohio site,
filed a lawsuit against the Company claiming, among other things, that the Company failed to indemnify and defend Textileather for certain contractual environmental obligations. A second suit related to past and future Resource Conservation Recovery
Act (RCRA) closure costs was filed in late 2009. On May 5, 2010, the District Court granted the Companys Motion for Summary Judgment, thereby dismissing the claims in the initial action. Textileather has appealed to the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals. Briefs have been filed and oral argument is scheduled for March 2, 2012. There are no District Court ordered dates in the second Textileather suit, but the parties are conducting informal discovery. As of
November 30, 2011, the estimated anticipated costs and accrued amount for the Textileather matter was $2.1 million which is included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter

Properties/Groundwater Cases/Sun Ridge LLC, et al. v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al./Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment Claim","Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment Claim
The Company previously manufactured products for the automotive industry at a Toledo, Ohio site, which was adjacent to the
Ottawa River. This facility was divested in 1990 and the Company indemnified the buyer for claims and liabilities arising out of certain pre-divestiture environmental matters. In August 2007, the Company, along with numerous other companies,
received from the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service a notice of a NRD Assessment Plan for the Ottawa River and Northern Maumee Bay. A group of PRPs, including the Company, was formed to respond to the NRD assessment and
to pursue funding from the Great Lakes Legacy Act for primary restoration. The restoration project performed by the group consisted of river dredging and land-filling river sediments with a total project cost in the range of approximately $47 to $49
million, one half of which was funded through the Great Lakes Legacy Act and the net project costs to the PRP group was estimated at $23.5 to $24.5 million. The dredging of the river that began in December 2009 has been completed. In February 2011,
the parties reached an agreement on allocation. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of the Companys share of anticipated costs for the NRD matter was $2.1 million to $3.9 million and the accrued amount was $2.1 million which is

Properties/Asbestos Litigation","Asbestos Litigation
The Company has been, and continues to be, named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury or death due to exposure to asbestos in building materials, products, or in manufacturing operations.
The majority of cases are pending in Texas and Pennsylvania. There were 146 asbestos cases pending as of November 30, 2011.
Given the lack of any significant consistency to claims (i.e., as to product, operational site, or other relevant assertions) filed against the Company, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate
of the future costs of pending claims or unasserted claims. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for such contingencies.

On November 23, 2011, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aerojet, entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Attorney in Sacramento, California, acting on behalf of the U.S. of
America, in connection with a subpoena the Company received on January 6, 2010 relating to the allowability of certain costs under its U.S. Government-related prime and subcontracts. In connection with the settlement, the Company paid $3.3
million in fiscal 2011 and agreed not to seek reimbursement for the costs of the investigation and defense of this issue. The investigation focused on certain corporate costs incurred with respect to proxy expenses in 2004 and 2006. The Company
cooperated fully with the investigation.
On September 23, 2010, the Company received a subpoena duces
tecum from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, acting on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General of the DoD, requesting that the Company produce a variety of documents pertaining to the use of certain cost estimating factors under
its contracts with the DoD. The investigation is still in the early stages and no financial demand has been made; accordingly, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what the outcome of this civil investigation will be or the impact,
if any, the investigation may have on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for at November 30, 2011. The Company has and continues to
cooperate fully with the investigation and is responding to the subpoena.

Properties/Snappon SA Wrongful Discharge Claims","Snappon SA Wrongful Discharge Claims
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a manufacturing facility in Chartres, France owned by Snappon SA, a
subsidiary of the Company, previously involved in the automotive business. In accordance with French law, Snappon SA negotiated with the local works council regarding the implementation of a social plan for the employees. Following the
implementation of the social plan, approximately 188 of the 249 former Snappon employees sued Snappon SA in the Chartres Labour Court alleging wrongful discharge. The claims were heard in two groups. On February 19, 2009, the Versailles Court
of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 2 plaintiffs and based on this, the Court awarded 1.9 million plus interest. On April 7, 2009, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 1 plaintiffs and based on
this, the Court awarded 1.0 million plus interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the Paris Commercial Court, and the claims will
likely be discharged through those proceedings. The Company has accrued a loss contingency of 2.9 million plus interest for this matter.

Unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms
we, our and us refer to GenCorp Inc. and all of its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with
an overview of our business and operations, followed by a discussion of our results of operations, including results of our operating segments, for the past three fiscal years. We then provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources,
including discussions of our cash flows, debt arrangements, sources of capital, and contractual obligations. In the next section, we discuss the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and
judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.
The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report, the risk factors appearing in
Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1. Business of this Report. Historical results set forth in Item 6. Selected Financial Data and
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report should not be taken as indicative of our future operations.

Overview
We are a manufacturer of aerospace and defense
products and systems with a real estate segment that includes activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. We develop and manufacture propulsion systems for defense and space applications, and
armaments for precision tactical and long range weapon systems applications.
A summary of the significant
financial highlights for fiscal 2011 which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition is presented below.

Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased to $918.1 million from $857.9 million for fiscal 2010.

Net income for fiscal 2011 was $2.9 million, or $0.05 diluted income per share, compared to a net income of $6.8 million, or $0.12 diluted
income per share, for fiscal 2010.

Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2011 was $115.4 million or 12.6% of net sales, compared to $110.7 million or 12.9% of net
sales, for fiscal 2010.

Segment performance (Non-GAAP measure) before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit plan expense, and unusual
items was $114.2 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $104.9 million for fiscal 2010.

Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 totaled $76.8 million, compared to $148.1 million in fiscal 2010.

Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure) in fiscal 2011 totaled $55.7 million, compared to $131.2 million in fiscal 2010.

As of November 30, 2011, we had $138.4 million in net debt (Non-GAAP measure) compared to $188.5 million as of November 30, 2010.
We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on GAAP. A
reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Managements Discussion and Analysis under the heading Operating Segment Information and Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.
We are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the
global security environment, as well as continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies
across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.

Major Customers
The principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the
purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending.
Customers that represented more than 10% of net sales for the fiscal years presented are as follows:

Sales in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 directly and indirectly to the U.S. government
and its agencies, including sales to our significant customers discussed above, totaled $855.8 million, $786.1 million, and $701.3 million, respectively. The Standard Missile program, which is included in the U.S. government
sales, represented 24%, 26%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The demand for certain of our services and products is directly related to the level of funding of government programs.

Industry Update
For the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ending September 30, 2012 and beyond, federal department/agency budgets are expected to remain under severe pressure due to the financial impacts from
spending cap agreements contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as from ongoing military operations and the cumulative effects of annual federal budget deficits and rising U.S. federal debt. As a result, the DoD budget is expected to
decrease by $21 billion for GFY 2012 relative to the Administration requested level and by $46 billion in the GFY 2013 budget request to be submitted by the Administration in February 2012. The NASA budget will decline by $924 million for GFY 2012
relative to the Administrations requested level and is expected to decline slightly for GFY 2013.
Nevertheless, Aerojet is well-positioned to benefit from continued DoD investment in high priority transformational
systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations in the Middle East, and systems that meet new worldwide threats. The Administration has indicated a
commitment to maintain adequate, albeit lower levels of funding for the DoD than those experienced during the height of conflicts in the Middle East while building defense capabilities for the 21st century. Priority areas that impact our products
include: fully equipping U.S. forces for the missions they face; maintaining situational awareness; preserving air supremacy; maintaining forces at sea; ensuring access to and freedom of space; and developing pragmatic and cost effective missile
defense systems.
In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act took effect impacting GFYs 2011-2013. The Authorization
Act aimed to: safely retire the Space Shuttle; extend the International Space Station through 2020; continue the development of the multipurpose crew exploration vehicle; build a new heavy lift launch vehicle; invest in new space technologies; and
sustain and grow the science and aeronautics programs at NASA. We are well-positioned to succeed among our competitors due to our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing contracts with both traditional and emerging launch providers.
Additionally, we are the main propulsion provider for the multipurpose crew vehicle and plan to compete for elements of the newly announced heavy lift launch vehicle. However, funding levels for both GFY 2011 and GFY 2012 were both below the
authorized level, and we anticipate this trend continuing in GFY 2013.
As a part of the Budget Control Act of
2011 (Public Law 112-25) (the debt-ceiling and deficit-reduction compromise agreement signed into law on August 2, 2011), approximately $487 billion in defense spending cuts

Environmental Matters
Our current and former business
operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes.
Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all
applicable environmental laws and regulations.
As of November 30, 2011, the aggregate range of our
anticipated environmental costs was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million. See Note 7(d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the environmental reserve activity for fiscal 2011.
Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs
are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to
the consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of
operations. However, we are seeking to amend our agreement with the U.S. government to increase the amount allocable to U.S. government contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this pursuit.
The inclusion of such environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government does impact our competitive pricing
and earnings; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.

Capital Structure
We have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of
November 30, 2011 and 2010, we had $326.4 million and $396.7 million of debt principal, respectively.

Retirement Benefits
As of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, our total defined benefit pension plan assets,
total projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation for our qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4 million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA) requires
underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified measurement dates. Our funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for our tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% funding target ratio required under the PPA. The required funded ratio to be met as of the November 30, 2011 measurement

Implementation of ERP System
During fiscal 2010, we conducted a thorough review of the business to assess the effectiveness of our current business processes and supporting information systems. After extensive study and analysis, we
determined that there are many potential benefits from the investment in a state-of-the-art ERP system. The benefits will be achieved through the integration of our data and processes into one single system based upon industry best business
practices.
We engaged a consulting firm to work with us to evaluate which ERP system would provide us with the
best business value while maximizing the long-term benefits. The analysis included multiple factors such as how the system would improve operational affordability, organizational alignment, transactional efficiency, and flexibility to adapt to
future business opportunities. We selected Oracle as our ERP solution and work began on the project in fiscal 2011.
We have committed a full-time cross-functional team of employees to work with our ERP partner and our systems integrator. This team is responsible for ensuring that the system configuration is consistent
with our business requirements and best business practices, coordinating data migration, addressing change management issues, testing controls, resolving implementation issues and developing a user training program. We anticipate the one-time cost
of implementation, both capital and expense, will range from $27 million to $30 million, consisting primarily of software and hardware costs, system integrator costs, internal labor costs, and data migration. We anticipate completing
the ERP project by the first quarter of 2013. Through December 2011, we have expended $10.6 million of our one-time implementation costs of which $9.0 million represents capital.
We expect that the new ERP system will provide reliable, transparent, and real-time data access providing us with the
opportunity to make better and faster business decisions. We expect the integration among various functional areas will lead to improved communication, productivity and efficiency. These improvements should enhance our ability to respond to our
customers needs and lead to increased customer satisfaction. Other advantages we expect to realize by centralization of our current systems into an ERP system are to eliminate the problem of synchronizing changes between multiple systems,
improve coordination of business processes that cross functional boundaries and provide a top-down view of the enterprise.

million in the various air-breathing propulsion programs primarily due to the prior years awards on SSST and T3 contracts; (ii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Hawk program resulting in $24.8 million of additional net sales; and
(iii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Bomb Live Unit  129B composite case resulting in $22.2 million of additional net sales. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $22.0 million on the Orion program due to
NASA funding constraints.
**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the
following: (i) an increase of $46.6 million in the various Standard Missile programs primarily related to awards received in fiscal 2009 on the divert and attitude control system contracts; (ii) increased deliveries on the GMLRS
program generating $19.9 million of additional net sales; and (iii) the release of NASA funding constraints on the Orion crew module and service module propulsion program generating $18.0 million of additional net sales. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by a decline in deliveries of rocket motors under the Atlas V program in fiscal 2010 of $21.4 million compared to the prior year.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in costs of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an
increase of $37.2 million of non-cash aerospace and defense retirement benefit plan expense in the fiscal 2010 compared to the prior period. See discussion of Retirement Benefit Plans below. The increase in retirement benefit plan
expense was partially offset by overall improvement in contract performance due to lower overhead expenses and higher sales. The decrease in overhead costs in fiscal 2010 is a result of cost saving initiatives implemented by management.

Income tax provision (benefit)
$
6.1
$
(3.9

$
(17.6

The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to a Private Letter Ruling
(PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing us to revoke our election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. As a result of the PLR, an income tax
benefit of $6.3 million was recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million relating to prior years offset by
$0.1 million of deferred tax expense for fiscal 2010.
The income tax benefit of $17.6 million in
fiscal 2009 was primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year

Discontinued Operations:
On August 31, 2004, we completed the sale of our GDX Automotive business. On November 30, 2005,
we completed the sale of our Fine Chemicals business. The remaining subsidiaries after the sale of GDX Automotive, including Snappon SA, and the Fine Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In November 2003, we announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. In June 2004, we completed the legal process for closing the facility and establishing a social
plan. During fiscal 2009, an expense of approximately 2.9 million ($3.8 million) was recorded related to legal judgments rendered against Snappon SA under French law, related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees
of Snappon SA. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the Paris Commercial Court (see Note 7(b) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Operating Segment Information:
We evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are:
corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and provisions for unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in
understanding our underlying operational performance. Specifically, we believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management
internally assesses operational performance.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $27.7
million in the various air-breathing propulsion programs primarily due to the prior years awards on SSST and T3 contracts; (ii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Hawk program resulting in $24.8 million of additional net sales; and
(iii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Bomb Live Unit  129B composite case resulting in $22.2 million of additional net sales. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $22.0 million on the Orion program due to
NASA funding constraints.
The increase in the fiscal 2011 segment margin was driven by (i) a decrease in retirement benefit expense of $8.3 million and
(ii) favorable contract performance across multiple product lines. These factors were partially offset by (i) higher environmental related costs of $8.7 million; (ii) an increase of $6.4 million in costs on a space contract related to
a test failure; and (iii) an increase in costs of $6.8 million on missile defense contracts related to inefficiencies and a test failure/re-work on rocket motors.
**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the

program generating $19.9 million of additional net sales; and (iii) the release of NASA funding constraints on the Orion crew module and service module propulsion program generating $18.0 million of additional net sales. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by a decline in deliveries of rocket motors under the Atlas V program in fiscal 2010 of $21.4 million compared to the prior year.
The decrease in the fiscal 2010 segment margin was driven by the increase in retirement benefit expense of $37.2 million, partially offset by
higher sales and lower overhead costs.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to segment performance (discussed above), we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational
performance called Adjusted EBITDAP. We use this metric to further our understanding of the historical and prospective consolidated core operating performance of our segments, net of expenses incurred by our corporate activities in the ordinary,
ongoing and customary course of our operations. Further, we believe that to effectively compare the core operating performance metric from period to period on a historical and prospective basis, the metric should exclude items relating to retirement
benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on the earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our operations. Accordingly, we define
Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted by interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefit expense, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective
of such ordinary, ongoing and customary course activities. Adjusted EBITDAP does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

In addition to segment performance and Adjusted EBITDAP, we provide the Non-GAAP financial
measures of free cash flow and net debt. We use these financial measures, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that these
financial measures are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our business using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals.

Environmental Matters
Our policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote
a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that
resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.
Estimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these
activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:

accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our
proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and

record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.
In addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring
costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which totaled $7.1 million in fiscal 2011, $8.8 million in fiscal 2010, and $8.4 million in fiscal 2009.

Reserves
We review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. We have an established practice of
estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increase, the reliability of
such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal
proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is
more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise such estimates as new information becomes available. We cannot

The $32.9 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to
the following items: (i) $9.0 million associated with water replacement; (ii) $7.6 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $2.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Fullerton,
California site; (iv) $2.5 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (v) $2.4 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden site; and (vi) $8.8 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $36.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $13.7 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $9.8 million associated with environmental settlements; (iii) $4.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site;
(iii) $1.5 million of additions for remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $1.2 million associated with replacement water; and (v) $5.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $23.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $11.3 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.4 million of increases to the Sacramento site primarily related to increases in operating costs for operable treatment units and environmental
sampling and analysis cost increases; (iii) $2.0 million associated with replacement water; (iv) $2.0 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site; (v) $1.6 million associated with new remediation treatment
facilities; and (vi) $2.2 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The effect of the
final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be predicted with complete certainty due to changes in both the amount and timing of future expenditures as well as regulatory or
technological changes. We believe, on the basis of presently available information, that the resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, liquidity and/or financial condition. We will continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective
remediation alternatives and associated technologies.

Estimated Recoveries
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered.
Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures
eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.
Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its
former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of
fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. See additional information below.
Allowable environmental costs are included as a component of general and administrative costs in the pricing of all
government contracts and allocated to contracts based on government approved cost accounting practices. Aerojets mix of contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through
forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets
commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.

Our applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the Northrop
Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental reserve until an
arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop Agreement, there can be
no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Adoption of New Accounting Principles
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard which requires additional disclosures for plan assets of
defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The required disclosures include a description of the Companys investment policies and strategies, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. As the accounting standard only
impacts disclosures, the new standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard that provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether
paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, we retrospectively adjusted our earnings per share data (including any amounts related to
interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform to the new standard. The adoption of the new standard did not change previously reported earnings per share amounts.
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard related to convertible debt securities that, upon
conversion, may be settled by the issuer, fully or partially, in cash (See Note 5).
As of
December 1, 2010, we adopted the new accounting standards related to the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition that applies to research or development transactions in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving
uncertain future events or circumstances. The adoption of the new standards did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of September 1, 2011, we adopted the FASB amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Previous guidance
required that an entity test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a second step is performed to measure the
amount of the impairment loss. Under this new amendment an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is
less than its carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB
issued updated guidance to improve disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This update requires entities to (i) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and
describe the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately (i.e., on a gross basis rather than as one net number), information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of changes in Level 3 fair value
measurements. The update requires fair value disclosures by class of assets and liabilities rather than by major category or line item in the statement of financial

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The $76.8 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of net income adjusted
for non-cash expenses (defined as depreciation, amortization, stock compensation, tax benefit on stock-based awards, retirement benefit expense, and loss on debt repurchased and bank amendment) which generated $85.6 million in fiscal 2011. These
factors were partially offset by a net cash usage of $9.7 million in noncurrent assets and liabilities primarily related to changes in the environmental remediation recoveries and reserves.
The $148.1 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was due to a $69.1 million increase
in cash provided by working capital (defined as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, contract advances, income tax related, and other current assets and liabilities). The increase in working capital is due to the following:
(i) an increase in contract advances of $44.0 million from prior year; (ii) a decrease in inventories of $10.7 million primarily due to an increase in customer progress payments; and (iii) an increase in

Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities
During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we had capital expenditures of $21.1 million, $16.9 million, and
$14.3 million, respectively. The majority of our capital expenditures directly supports our contract and customer requirements and is primarily made for asset replacement, capacity expansion, development of new projects, and safety and
productivity improvements.
During fiscal 2011, we generated $26.7 million of net cash from the sale of
marketable securities. During fiscal 2010, we made a net cash investment of $26.6 million in marketable securities.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
During fiscal
2011, we had $70.1 million in debt repayments (see below) and $1.8 million in vendor financing payments. In addition, we incurred $4.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendment to the Senior Credit Facility.
During fiscal 2010, cash of $200.0 million was generated reflecting the issuance of the 4 1/16% Debentures in
December 2009, offset by $240.2 million in debt repayments. In addition, we incurred $7.7 million in debt issuance costs and had vendor financing repayments of $1.5 million.
During fiscal 2009, net cash used for debt principal payments was $2.0 million. Additionally, we incurred
$0.4 million in debt issuance costs in fiscal 2009.

On November 18, 2011, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement
(the Senior Credit Facility) with the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Senior Credit Facility replaces our prior credit facility and, among other things,
(i) extends the maturity date to November 18, 2016 (which date may be accelerated in certain cases); and (ii) replaces the existing revolving credit facility and credit-linked facility with (x) a revolving credit facility in an
aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million (with a $100.0 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $5.0 million subfacility for swingline loans) and (y) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0
million. The term loan facility will amortize at a rate of 5.0% of the original principal amount per annum to be paid in equal quarterly installments with any remaining amounts due on the maturity date. Outstanding indebtedness under the Senior
Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, in general without premium or penalty.

We were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of

Outlook
Short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs
related to our retirement benefit plans, capital and environmental expenditures, and debt service requirements. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating
plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, and interest and principal payments on our debt.
As disclosed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we may be required to make significant
contributions in the future to fund our defined benefit pension plan.
As disclosed in Notes 7(b) and 7(c)
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will
have on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.
Major factors that could adversely
impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates
on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.

Contractual Obligations
We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other
liabilities, and purchase commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2011 and their expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for postretirement medical and life benefits reflect the
estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. The obligation related to postretirement medical and life benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect
the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
As of November 30, 2011, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $1.5 million. Due to the
uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.
The PPA, as discussed above, will require underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed
intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We may be required to make significant cash contributions in the future to fund our defined benefit pension plan, a portion of which we may not be able to immediately recover from our government
contracts.
We also issue purchase orders and make other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and
supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from
customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract was terminated.

Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
As of November 30, 2011, arrangements with off-balance sheet risk, consisted of:

$67.1 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit expiring within the next twelve months, the majority of which may be renewed,
primarily to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.

Up to $120.0 million aggregate in guarantees by GenCorp of Aerojets obligations to U.S. government agencies for environmental
remediation activities.

Guarantees, jointly and severally, by our material domestic subsidiaries of our obligations under our Senior Credit Facility and our 9

Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for
certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Management discusses those areas that require significant judgment with the audit
committee of our board of directors. All of our financial disclosures in our filings with the SEC have been reviewed with the audit committee. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others
might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are
revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes and litigation matters related to discontinued operations,
which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.
For a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition
In our Aerospace and Defense segment, recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and
estimates related to the contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion requires the use
of significant judgment. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised as necessary. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed include labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of
the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated

Other Contract Considerations
Our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the
U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. government contracts.
For example, costs such as those related to pension contributions in accordance with the PPA that are in excess of CAS allowable pension costs, charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and
therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract
accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are
per-

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair
values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be
recoverable. We evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, we evaluate qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial
performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than
50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of our recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1, 2011, we
evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a
substantial margin. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, we primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and estimates
about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year financial
forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the rates of
return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, we evaluated the results of
the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. We also ensured that the reporting unit fair value was reasonable given the market
value of the entire company as of the valuation date.
There can be no assurance that our estimates and
assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

Retirement Benefit Plans
We have a frozen defined benefit pension plan that previously covered substantially all salaried and hourly employees. In
addition, we provide medical and life insurance benefits (postretirement benefits) to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including administrative
costs, interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.

The discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market
conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and accordingly the funded status of the pension plan. The discount rate was determined at November 30, 2011 for
our pension plans, and is subject to change each year based on changes in overall market interest rates. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched
to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the plans historical investment performance,
its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this analysis, we have assumed a long
term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets
and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be
amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate
used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although
the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.
In addition, we maintain medical and life benefits other than pensions that are not funded.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations

Contingencies and Litigation
We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs
and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any
particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings. See Notes 7(b) and 7(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more
detailed information on litigation exposure.

Reserves for Environmental Remediation and Recoverable
from the U.S. Government and Other Third Parties for Environmental Remediation Costs
For a discussion
of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see Environmental Matters above and Notes 7(c) and 7(d) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a
liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. Management has a well-established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be
estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing
remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote
a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing
technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible
parties will be able to fulfill their commitments at sites where we may be jointly or severally liable.
At the
time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some of our environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of our products and
services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. We consider the recovery probable based on the Global Settlement Agreement, Northrop Agreement, government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving
reimbursement for such costs.

Income Taxes
We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries.
The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.
The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. We have established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of
our net deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits, given historical losses including accumulated other comprehensive losses. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in
the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.
Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that certain
positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference
between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the

Policies and Procedures
As an element of our normal
business practice, we have established policies and procedures for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
The objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to make overall borrowing costs more predictable. To achieve this
objective, we may use interest rate hedge transactions or other interest rate hedge instruments to manage the net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings and to balance our fixed rate compared to floating rate debt.
We did not enter into any interest rate hedge transactions or instruments during the past three fiscal years.

Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk principally due to changes in interest rates. Debt with interest rate risk
includes borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Other than pension assets and liabilities, we do not have any significant exposure to interest rate risk related to our investments.
As of November 30, 2011, our debt totaled $326.4 million: $276.4 million, or 85%, was at an average fixed rate of
5.56%; and $50.0 million, or 15%, was at a variable rate of 3.86%.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of GenCorp Inc.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GenCorp Inc. and its subsidiaries at November 30, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended November 30, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2011, based on criteria established in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a. Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations
The consolidated financial statements of GenCorp Inc. (GenCorp or the Company) include the
accounts of the parent company and its wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company is a manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems with a real estate segment that includes
activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of the Companys excess real estate assets. The Companys continuing operations are organized into two segments:

Aerospace and Defense 

Real Estate 
The
Companys fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of the Companys subsidiary, Aerojet, ends on the last Saturday of November.
On August 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its GDX Automotive (GDX) business. On
November 30, 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Fine Chemicals business. The remaining subsidiaries of GDX, including Snappon SA, and the Fine Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations (see Note 12).
Certain reclassifications have been made to financial information for prior years to conform to the current years
presentation. The Company reclassified recoverable amounts from the U.S. government on conditional asset retirement obligations to Other noncurrent assets, a component of the consolidated balance sheets, $12.3 million and $10.7 million
as of November 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was previously reported as Recoverable from the U.S. government and other third parties for environmental remediation costs and other. These reclassifications had no effect on
previously reported net income or net cash flows from operating activities. See Note 3(f).
The preparation of
the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Out of Period Adjustments
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts. The out of period adjustments relate to the Company
incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys fiscal 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. The out
of period adjustments resulted in the Company under reporting $0.6 million in net income in fiscal 2011. Management believes that such amount is not material to fiscal 2011 or previously reported financial statements.
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax
benefit and related balance sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments in fiscal 2010 combined with the effects of the fiscal 2011 adjustments
described above resulted in the Company reporting $2.6 million of additional net income in fiscal 2010. Management believes that such amounts are not material to fiscal 2010 or previously reported financial statements.

b. Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less are
considered to be cash equivalents. The Company aggregates its cash balances by bank, and reclassifies any negative balances, if applicable, to accounts payable.

c. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The accounting standards use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3,
defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The following are measured at fair value:

determined to approximate carrying value.

d. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable associated with long-term contracts consist of billed and unbilled amounts. Billed
amounts include invoices presented to customers that have not been paid. Unbilled amounts relate to revenues that have been recorded and billings that have not been presented to customers. Amounts for overhead disallowances are reflected in unbilled
receivables and primarily represent estimates of potential overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.
Other receivables represent amounts billed where revenues were not derived from long-term contracts.

e. Inventories
Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost method. Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress represent recoverable costs incurred for production, contract-specific facilities and equipment, allocable operating
overhead, advances to suppliers, environmental expenses and, in the case of contracts with the U.S. government, bid and proposal, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of
the U.S. government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to such contracts as a result of performance-based and progress payments. Such progress payments are reflected as an offset against
the related inventory balances.

f. Income Taxes
The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries. The
deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.
The carrying value of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a
substantial portion of

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
its net deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits, given historical losses including accumulated other comprehensive losses. A valuation allowance is
required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including the Companys past and future performance, the market
environment in which it operates, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.
Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, the Company
believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. The
Companys tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial
statements for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial
authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold,
the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities,
adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions
impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.

g. Property,
Plant and Equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Refurbishment costs are
capitalized in the property accounts, whereas ordinary maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by accelerated methods based on the following useful lives:
Buildings and improvements
9  40 years
Machinery and equipment
3  19 years

h. Real Estate Held for Entitlement and Leasing
The Company capitalizes all costs associated with the real estate entitlement and leasing process. The Company classifies
activities related to the entitlement, sale, and leasing of its excess real estate assets as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

i. Goodwill
Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events
occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and 2010, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, the Company evaluates qualitative factors (including macroeconomic
conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it
is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill
impairment test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of
events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of the Companys recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1,
2011, the Company evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying
amount. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Companys Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, the Company primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and
estimates about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year
financial forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the
rates of return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of the Companys estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, the
Company evaluated the results of the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. The Company also ensured that the reporting unit
fair value was reasonable given the market value of the entire Company as of the valuation date.
There can be
no assurance that the Companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect, the Company may
be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

j. Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, and licenses are recorded at cost or when
acquired as part of a business combination at estimated fair value. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized based on when they provide the Company economic benefit, or using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful life.
Amortization periods for identifiable intangible assets range from 20 years to 27 years.

k. Environmental Remediation
The Company expenses, on a current basis, recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and contamination
in ongoing operations. The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases only a range
of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. The
Companys environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions,

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of
time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted
laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill
their commitments at sites where the Company may be jointly or severally liable. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, the Company records an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some
of the Companys environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of its products and services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. The Company considers the recovery probable based on the Global
Settlement Agreement, Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop) Agreement, government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs (see Notes 7(c) and (d)).

l. Retirement Benefits
The Company has a frozen defined benefit pension plan that previously covered substantially all salaried and hourly
employees. In addition, the Company provides medical and life insurance benefits (postretirement benefits) to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans,
including administrative costs, interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. The Company also sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is
available to all employees. See Note 6.

m. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
Conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) are legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and the related asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related assets by the same amount as the liability. Asset
retirement costs are subsequently depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company records period-to-period changes in the CARO liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to
either the timing or the amount of the estimate of the undiscounted cash flows.
The Companys estimate of
CAROs associated with owned properties relates to estimated costs necessary for the legally required removal or remediation of various regulated materials, primarily asbestos disposal and radiological decontamination of an ordnance manufacturing
facility. For CAROs that are not expected to be retired in the next fifteen (15) years, the Company estimated the retirement date of such asset retirement obligations to be thirty (30) years from the date of adoption of the applicable
accounting standard on November 30, 2006. For leased properties, such obligations relate to the estimated cost of contractually required property restoration.

n. Advance Payments on Contracts
The Company receives advances from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. Such advances or
billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings, other than those reflected as a reduction of inventories as progress payments, are classified as current liabilities.

o. Loss Contingencies
The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, has accrued its estimate of the probable
costs and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations or cash
flows for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in estimates or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings.

p. Warranties
The Company provides
product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales. The majority of the Companys warranties are a one-year standard warranty for parts, workmanship, and compliance with specifications. On occasion, the Company has made commitments
beyond the standard warranty obligation. While the Company has contracts with warranty provisions, there is not a history of any significant warranty claims experience. A reserve for warranty exposure is made on a product by product basis when it is
both estimable and probable. These costs are included in the programs estimate at completion and are expensed in accordance with the Companys revenue recognition methodology as allowed under GAAP for that particular contract.

q. Revenue Recognition
The Company considers the nature of the individual underlying contract and the type of products and services provided in
determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. Each method is applied consistently to all contracts having similar characteristics, as described below. The Company typically accounts for these contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method, and progress is measured on a cost-to-cost or units-of-delivery basis. Sales are recognized using various measures of progress depending on the contractual terms and scope of work of the contract. The Company
recognizes revenue on a units-of-delivery basis when contracts require unit deliveries on a frequent and routine basis. Sales using this measure of progress are recognized at the contractually agreed upon unit price. Where the scope of work on
contracts principally relates to research and/or development efforts, or the contract is predominantly a development effort with few deliverable

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
units, the Company recognizes revenue on a cost-to-cost basis. In this case, sales are recognized as costs are incurred and include estimated earned fees or profits calculated on the basis of the
relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Revenue on service or time and material contracts is recognized when performed. If at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract, the loss is recognized
immediately.
Certain government contracts contain cost or performance incentive provisions that provide for
increased or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. Incentive and award fees, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, are included in estimated contract revenue
at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and anticipated performance. The Company continually evaluates its performance and incorporates any anticipated changes in penalties and
cost incentives into its revenue and earnings calculations. Performance incentives, which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally are not recognized until an event occurs.
Revenue from real estate asset sales is recognized when a sufficient down-payment has been received, financing has been
arranged and title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. The allocation to cost of sales on real estate asset sales is based on a relative fair market value computation of the land sold which includes the
basis on the Companys book value, capitalized entitlement costs, and an estimate of the Companys continuing financial commitment.
Revenue that is not derived from long-term development and production contracts, or real estate asset transactions, is recognized when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists, delivery has
occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and payment from the customer is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of provisions for customer pricing allowances.

r. Research and Development
Company-sponsored research and development (R&D) expenses were $27.4 million in fiscal 2011,
$17.4 million in fiscal 2010, and $15.4 million in fiscal 2009. Company-sponsored R&D expenses include the costs of technical activities that are useful in developing new products, services, processes, or techniques, as well as
expenses for technical activities that may significantly improve existing products or processes. These expenses are generally allocated among all contracts and programs in progress under U.S. government contractual arrangements.
Customer-sponsored R&D expenditures, which are funded under government contracts, totaled $276.0 million in fiscal
2011, $283.7 million in fiscal 2010, and $245.3 million in fiscal 2009. Expenditures under customer-sponsored R&D funded government contracts are accounted for as sales and cost of products sold.

s. Stock-based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in the statements of operations at the grant-date fair value of stock
awards issued to employees and directors over the vesting period. The Company elected to use the short-cut method for determining the historical pool of windfall tax benefits and the tax law ordering approach for purposes of determining whether an
excess tax benefit has been realized.

t. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset, or related groups of assets, may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business
climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of
significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If
the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, then the Company would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $1.6 million
impairment charge associated with the write-down of a long-lived asset.
A long-lived asset classified as
held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In the period that the held for sale criteria are met, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for any initial
adjustment of the long-lived asset amount. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of a long-lived asset is recognized on the date of sale.

u. Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign currency transaction (losses) and gains were $(0.3) million in fiscal 2011, $1.7 million in fiscal 2010, and
($1.6) million in fiscal 2009 which are reported as a component of discontinued operations. The Companys foreign currency transactions were associated with the Companys former GDX business, including Snappon SA, which is classified
as discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.

v. Related Parties
A
member of the Companys board of directors is manager of Steel Partners LLC, the manager of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (Steel Holdings). Steel Holdings owns 99% of SPH Group Holdings LLC (SPH Holdings) and is a

w. Concentrations

Dependence upon government programs and contracts
Sales in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 directly and indirectly to the U.S. government and its agencies, including sales
to the Companys significant customers discussed below, totaled $855.8 million, $786.1 million, and $701.3 million, respectively. The Standard Missile program, which is included in the U.S. government sales, represented 24%,
26%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The demand for certain of the Companys services and products is directly related to the level of funding of government programs.

and trade receivables. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are held and managed by recognized financial institutions and are subject to the Companys investment policy. The
investment policy outlines minimum acceptable credit ratings for each type of investment and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue. The Company does not believe significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these investments.

Dependence on Single Source and Other Third Party Suppliers
The Company uses a significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government
regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, the Company is often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often
discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. The Company is often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. To date the Company has been successful in establishing replacement materials
and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium
perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry with actual pricing based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the
Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to
require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
The Company is also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw
materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. The Company continues to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products
have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, the Company may not be able to continue to negotiate with its customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The
DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While
availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to the Companys programs.
Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of the Companys key raw materials, difficulty qualifying new sources of
supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, and/or a continuing volatility in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

Workforce
As of November 30, 2011, 12% of the Companys 3,268 employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements. In June 2011, the Company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with substantially all of its covered employees through June 2014.

x. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard which requires additional disclosures for plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The required
disclosures include a description of the Companys investment policies and strategies, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair
value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of December 1, 2009, the
Company adopted the accounting standard that provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in
the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, the Company retrospectively adjusted its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial
data) to conform to the new standard. The adoption of the new standard did not change previously reported earnings per share amounts.
As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard related to convertible debt securities that, upon conversion, may be settled by the issuer, fully or partially, in cash (See
Note 5).
As of December 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new accounting standards related to the use
of the milestone method of revenue recognition that applies to research or development transactions in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving uncertain future events or circumstances. The adoption of the new standards did not have
a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of
September 1, 2011, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Previous guidance required that an entity test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. Under this new amendment an entity is not
required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.

y. New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This update
requires entities to (i) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately (i.e., on a gross basis
rather than as one net number), information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements. The update requires fair value disclosures by class of assets and liabilities rather
than by major category or line item in the statement of financial position. Disclosures regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
in both Level 2 and Level 3 are also required. For all portions of the update except the gross presentation of activity in the Level 3 roll forward, this standard was effective for the Company on March 1, 2010. For the gross presentation of
activity in the Level 3 roll forward, the new disclosures will be presented in the Companys quarterly financial statements for the period ending

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
February 29, 2012. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard will not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.
In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on disclosure of supplementary pro forma
information for business combinations. The new guidance requires that pro forma financial information should be prepared as if the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual period. The guidance is effective for the
Company for business combinations with acquisition dates occurring in and from the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
In May 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures. The new guidance
clarified the concepts applicable for fair value measurement and requires new disclosures, with a particular focus on Level 3 measurements. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be
applied retrospectively. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance.
In June 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance
eliminates one of the presentation options provided by current U.S. GAAP, that is to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In addition, it gives an entity the option to
present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is
effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

z. Subsequent Events
The Company evaluates events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are
issued for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The issuance of financial statements is the earlier of when the financial statements are widely distributed to all shareholders and other financial statements users or filed
with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).

The undistributed income allocated to participating securities was less than $0.1 million for all years presented. The Companys
outstanding unvested restricted shares contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Accordingly, the weighted average share balances treat the unvested restricted shares as participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant
to the two-class method. Application of the two-class method had no impact on EPS for all years presented.

The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to the Company obtaining a Private Letter
Ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing the Company to revoke its election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. The revocation is effective
as of the fiscal 2007 income tax return, allowing a deduction on an amended fiscal 2007 tax return of the remaining unamortized balance. As a result of the PLR, an income tax benefit of $6.3 million was

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million
relating to prior years offset by $0.1 million of deferred tax expense recorded for fiscal 2010.
The
income tax benefit of $17.6 million in fiscal 2009 is primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year carryback of tax net operating
losses for refund of prior years taxes. As a result of the clarifying language, the Company recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 an income tax benefit of $19.7 million, of which $14.5 million was for the release of the
valuation allowance associated with the utilization of the qualifying tax net operating losses and $5.2 million was for the recognition of affirmative claims related to previous uncertain tax positions associated with prior years refund
claims related to the qualifying costs.
A valuation allowance has been recorded to offset a substantial
portion of the net deferred tax assets at November 30, 2011 and 2010 to reflect the uncertainty of realization. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized.
A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which the Company operates, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carryback and carryforward
periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company determines cumulative losses on a
rolling twelve-quarter basis and the analysis includes the retirement benefit plan losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on all of its net deferred tax assets except for
the indefinite lived deferred tax assets relating to federal AMT credits and California research credits.
The
Company is routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While it is difficult to predict the outcome or timing of a particular tax matter, the Company believes it has adequately provided reserves for any reasonable foreseeable outcome
related to these matters.

penalties related to uncertain tax positions is $0.2 million. The years ended November 30, 2008 through November 30, 2010 remain open to examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the Companys other major taxing
jurisdictions, the tax years ended November 30, 2007 through November 20, 2010 remain open to examination.

Senior Credit Facility
On November 18, 2011, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Senior
Credit Facility) with the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Senior Credit Facility replaces the prior credit facility and, among other things, (i) extends the maturity
date to November 18, 2016 (which date may be accelerated in certain cases); and (ii) replaces the existing revolving credit facility and credit-linked facility with (x) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
up to $150.0 million (with a $100.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $5.0 million subfacility for swingline loans) and (y) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million. The term loan
facility will amortize at a rate of 5.0% of the original principal

amount per annum to be paid in equal quarterly installments with any remaining amounts due on the maturity date. Outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility may be voluntarily
prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, in general without premium or penalty.
As of November 30, 2011,
the Company had $67.1 million outstanding letters of credit under the $150.0 million revolving credit subfacility and had $50.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility.
In general, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR plus 350 basis points
(subject to downward adjustment), or the base rate as it is defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, the Company is charged a commitment fee of 50 basis points per annum on unused amounts of the revolving
credit facility and 350 basis points per annum (subject to downward adjustment), along with a fronting fee of 25 basis points per annum, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit.
The Company guarantees the payment obligations under the Senior Credit Facility. Any borrowings are further secured by
(i) all equity interests owned or held by the loan parties, including interests in the Companys Easton subsidiary and 66% of the voting stock (and 100% of the non-voting stock) of all present and future first-tier foreign subsidiaries of
the loan parties; (ii) substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property and assets of the loan parties; and (iii) certain real property owned by the loan parties located in Orange, Virginia and Redmond, Washington. The
Companys real property located in California, including the real estate holdings of Easton, are excluded from collateralization under the Senior Credit Facility.
The Company is subject to certain limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and
acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Senior Credit Facility includes events of default usual and customary for facilities of this nature, the occurrence of which could lead to an
acceleration of our obligations thereunder. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facility includes certain financial covenants, including that the Borrower maintain (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (subject to upward adjustment in
certain cases), calculated net of cash up to a maximum of $100.0; and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.40 to 1.00.

Pension Benefits
On November 25, 2008, the Company decided to amend the defined benefit pension and benefits restoration plans to freeze future accruals under such plans. Effective February 1, 2009 and
July 31, 2009, future benefit

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
accruals for non-collective bargaining-unit employees and collective bargaining unit employees were discontinued, respectively. No employees lost their previously earned pension benefits.
As of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, the total defined benefit pension plan assets,
total projected benefit obligations, and the unfunded pension obligation for the qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4 million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA)
requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified measurement dates. The funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for the
Companys tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% ratio required under the PPA. The required ratio to be met as of the November 30, 2011 measurement date is 100%. The final calculated PPA funded ratio
as of November 30, 2011 is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012.
In general, the PPA
requires companies with underfunded plans to make up the shortfall over a seven year period. These values are based on assumptions specified by the IRS, and are typically not the same as the amounts used for corporate financial reporting. On
June 25, 2010, the president signed the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (Pension Relief Act) into law. The Pension Relief Act allows pension plan sponsors to extend the
shortfall amortization period from the seven years required under the PPA to either nine years (with interest-only payments for the first two years) or 15 years for shortfall amortization bases created during the years for which relief is
elected. This election could be made for any two plan years during the period 2008-2011. The Company elected the funding relief for plan year beginning 2010 and expects to elect the funding relief for plan year beginning 2011 using the 15-year
alternative amortization.
The value of the unfunded accrued benefits and amount of required contribution each
year are based on a number of factors, including plan investment experience and interest rate environment and, as such, can fluctuate significantly from year to year. Companies may prepay contributions and, under certain circumstances, use those
prepayment credits to satisfy the required funding of the pension plans annual required contribution thereby allowing the Company to defer cash payments into the pension plan. The Company has accumulated $59.5 million in such prepayment
credits as of November 30, 2011. For fiscal 2012, the Company is not expecting to make a cash contribution to the pension plan.
The funded status of the pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plans assets, by any changes in U.S. law, and by changes in the statutory interest rates used
by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements or other plan experience. Accordingly, if the performance of the Companys plan assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the IRS
regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, the future contributions to the Companys underfunded pension plan could be significant in future periods.

The Company provides medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Generally, employees hired after January 1, 1997 are not
eligible for medical and life insurance benefits. The medical benefit plan provides for cost sharing between the Company and its retirees in the form of retiree contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance. Medical and life benefit obligations are
unfunded.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Benefits
The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.
Company contributions to the plan generally have been based on a percentage of employee contributions and, prior to April 15, 2009, the Companys contributions to the plan had been directed entirely in the GenCorp Stock Fund. Effective
January 15, 2009, the Company discontinued the employer matching component

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
to the defined contribution 401(k) plan for non-collective bargaining-unit employees. Effective March 15, 2009, transfers into the GenCorp Stock Fund were no longer permitted. Effective
April 15, 2009, all future contribution investment elections directed into the GenCorp Stock Fund were redirected to other investment options and the Companys collective bargaining-unit employee matching contributions are being made in
cash. Effective the first full payroll commencing in July 2010, for non-collective bargaining-unit employees, the Company reinstated in cash its matching contributions at the same level in effect prior to January 15, 2009 and invested according
to participants investment elections in effect at the time of contribution. The Companys contributions to the 401(k) plan were $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, $3.7 million in fiscal 2010, and $2.0 million in fiscal 2009.

b. Plan Results
Summarized below is the balance sheet impact of the Companys pension benefits and medical and life benefits. Pension
benefits include the consolidated qualified plan and the unfunded non-qualified plan for benefits provided to employees beyond those provided by the Companys qualified plans. Plan assets, benefit obligations, and the funded status of the plans
were determined at November 30, 2011 and 2010 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Benefits paid for medical and life benefits are net of the Medicare Part D Subsidy of $0.5 million and $0.6 million received in
fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
(2)
For fiscal 2011 and 2010, service cost for pension benefits represents the administrative costs of the pension plan.
(3)
Pension amounts include $17.2 million in fiscal 2011 and $16.8 million in fiscal 2010 for unfunded plans.
Due to freezing of the plan benefits in fiscal 2009, the accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension
plans was equal to the benefit obligation as of the November 30, 2011 and 2010 measurement dates.

Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of the
pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs
in future years. The accounting method the Company utilizes recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to
calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the
smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual retirement benefit expense, future expenses are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.

Certain actuarial assumptions, such as assumed discount rate, long-term rate of return, and assumed healthcare cost trend rates can have a significant effect on amounts reported for periodic cost of
pension benefits and medical and life benefits, as well as respective benefit obligation amounts. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the
expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. The Company evaluated the plans historical investment
performance, its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from the Companys external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this
analysis, the Company has assumed a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
The Company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the medical benefit plans. For fiscal 2011 medical benefit obligations, the Company assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase for pre and
post 65 participants in the per capita cost of covered healthcare claims with the rate decreasing over nine years until reaching 5.0%.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations as of November 30, 2011 and on expense for fiscal 2011:

d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy
The Companys investment policy is to maximize the total rate of return with a view toward
long-term funding objectives of the plan to ensure that funds are available to meet benefit obligations when due. The plan assets are diversified to the extent necessary to minimize risk and to achieve an optimal balance between risk and
return. The Companys investment strategy focuses on higher return seeking investments in actively managed investment vehicles with an emphasis toward alternative investment strategies and allows for diversification as to the type of
assets, investment strategies employed, and number of investment managers used to carry out this strategy. These strategies are achieved using diversified asset types, which may include cash, equities, fixed income, real estate, private equity
holdings and derivatives. Allocations between these asset types may change as a result of changing market conditions and tactical investment opportunities.
The Companys pension plans weighted average asset allocation and the investment policy asset allocation targets at November 30, 2011, by asset category, are as follows:

The following is a description of the significant investment strategies and valuation
methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such investments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are
held in money market accounts or invested in Short-Term Investment Funds (STIFs). Cash and cash equivalents held in money market accounts are classified as Level 1 investments. STIFs are not traded on an exchange and active market,
and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments.

Equity securities
Equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and
through a range of market capitalization in common stocks and Common Collective Trusts (CCTs). Common stocks are stated at fair value as quoted on a recognized securities exchange and are valued at the last reported sales price on the
last business day of the fiscal year and are classified as Level 1 investments. CCTs are not traded on an exchange and active market, however, the fair value is determined based on the underlying investments as traded in an exchange and active
market, and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments. Derivatives primarily include options and short equity positions, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Derivatives include
call and put options, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Investments sold short are short equity positions which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1
investments.

Fixed income securities
Fixed income securities are invested in a variety of instruments including but not limited to government securities,
corporate debt securities, and asset-backed securities.
U.S. government securities are valued at bid
evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 2 investments. Foreign government securities are priced by investment managers using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data,
proprietary models, or indicative quotes and are classified as Level 3 investments.
Corporate debt
securities are invested in corporate bonds and CCTs. Corporate bonds that are actively traded in a robust and visible market are classified as Level 1 investments. Corporate bonds that are valued at bid evaluations using observable and
market-based inputs are classified as Level 2 investments. CCTs are priced by investment managers using observable inputs of the underlying bond securities and are classified as Level 2 investments.
Asset-backed securities, including government-backed mortgage securities, non-government-backed collateralized mortgage
obligations, asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, are valued at bid evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable or unobservable inputs. These securities are classified as Level 2 investments if the
evaluated prices are calculated using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 3 investments if the evaluated prices are calculated using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data, proprietary models, or indicative
quotes.
Investments sold short are short fixed income positions which are classified as Level 1 investments if
they are listed on an exchange and active market, and are classified as Level 2 investments if they are valued at bid evaluation using observable and market-based inputs.

Forward exchange contracts
Forward exchange contracts are not exchange-traded but are priced based on observable input. They are classified as Level
2 investments.

Real estate investments
Real estate investments are interests in real property holdings where the underlying properties are valued by independent
appraisers employing valuation techniques such as capitalization of future rental income and/or sales of comparable properties. If applicable, the properties may also be valued based on current indicative interest received by the Company from
third parties. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Private equity holdings
Private equity holdings are primarily limited partnerships and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in
U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Private equity holdings are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV), which are estimated by investment managers using inputs in which little or no
public market data exists. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Alternative
investments
Alternative investments consist of hedge funds that employ a variety of investment
strategies. These funds invest across a range of equity and debt securities in a variety of industry sectors. Alternative investments are valued at NAV calculated by investment managers using a variety of valuation techniques for the underlying
investments. Since many of these valuations are based on unobservable inputs, they are classified as Level 3 investments.

predict the outcome of such proceedings with any degree of certainty. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency
amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and are refined each quarterly reporting period as additional information becomes available. For legal settlements where
there is no stated amount for interest, the Company will estimate an interest factor and discount the liability accordingly.
Summarized below are the outstanding matters the Company believes have more than a remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Groundwater Cases

South El Monte Operable Unit (SEMOU) Related Cases
In October 2002, Aerojet and approximately 65 other individual and corporate defendants were served with four civil suits
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that sought recovery of costs allegedly incurred or to be incurred in response to the contamination present at the South El Monte Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley
Superfund site. The plaintiffs claims against Aerojet were based upon allegations of discharges from a former site in the El Monte area. Aerojet investigations did not identify a credible connection between the contaminants identified by the
plaintiff water entities in the SEMOU and those detected at Aerojets former facility located in El Monte, California, near the SEMOU (East Flair Drive site). The cases served on October 30, 2002 were denominated as follows:

San Gabriel Valley Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority v. Aerojet-General
Corporation, et al.

Southern California Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

The City of Monterey Park v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et
al.
The contamination in the
SEMOU was also subject to a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) naming Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to conduct the remedial design and
remedial action in the SEMOU.
These cases have been settled. Under the settlement, the water entities released
Aerojet and the Company from liability for all groundwater contamination in the geographic confines of the SEMOU alleged to have originated from the East Flair Drive site. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court approved and entered a
partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) which also resolved Aerojets liability under the UAO. On August 25, 2011, the Court granted Aerojets motion
for good faith settlement conditioned upon the payment by Aerojet of its second settlement payment on or before December 5, 2011. The Company previously reserved for the settlement and there was no impact in fiscal 2011 to the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The Courts approval removes any contribution claims against Aerojet by other defendants. Aerojet paid the second settlement payment on December 5, 2011 and the Courts Order took effect on December 8,
2011.

Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA)
On July 1, 2009, the County of Sacramento (County) and SCWA filed a complaint against Aerojet and Boeing
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento,
County of Sacramento; Sacramento County Water Agency v. Aerojet-General Corporation and The Boeing Corporation [sic],  Civ. No. 2:09-at-1041. In the
complaint, the County and SCWA alleged that because groundwater contamination from various sources including Aerojet, McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), and the former Mather Air Force Base, was continuing, the County and SCWA
should be awarded unspecified monetary damages as well as declaratory and equitable relief. Aerojet, Boeing, the County and SCWA reached a final settlement effective October 31, 2011 and Aerojets payment obligations under the settlement
were fully satisfied in fiscal 2011. The Company previously reserved for the settlement and there was no impact in fiscal 2011 to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable subject to
the Global Settlement and Northrop Agreement allocations.

Sun Ridge LLC, et al. v. Aerojet-General
Corporation, et al.
In December 2011, Aerojet received notice of a lawsuit styled
Sun Ridge LLC, et al.
v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.,  Case No. 34-2011-00114675, filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The complaint,

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
which also names McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), was filed by owners of properties adjacent to the Aerojet property in Rancho Cordova, California and alleges damages
attributable to contamination of groundwater including diminution of property value and increased costs associated with ensuring water supplies in connection with the real estate development. Aerojet has not been served with the complaint and is
reviewing the allegations contained therein. In the event the lawsuit is served on Aerojet, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. Since this matter is in the early stages, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what
the outcome of this complaint will be. Accordingly, no estimate of liability has been accrued for this matter at November 30, 2011.

Asbestos Litigation
The Company has been, and continues to be, named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury or death due to exposure to asbestos in building materials, products, or in manufacturing operations.
The majority of cases are pending in Texas and Pennsylvania. There were 146 asbestos cases pending as of November 30, 2011.
Given the lack of any significant consistency to claims (i.e., as to product, operational site, or other relevant assertions) filed against the Company, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate
of the future costs of pending claims or unasserted claims. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued.

Subpoenas Duces
Tecum
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aerojet-General Corporation, entered into a settlement
agreement with the U.S. Attorney in Sacramento, California, acting on behalf of the U.S. of America, in connection with a subpoena the Company received on January 6, 2010 relating to the allowability of certain costs under its U.S.
Government-related prime and subcontracts. In connection with the settlement, the Company paid $3.3 million in fiscal 2011 and agreed not to seek reimbursement for the costs of the investigation and defense of this issue in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2011 (See Note 13). The Company cooperated fully with the investigation.
On September 23, 2010,
the Company received a subpoena duces tecum from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, acting on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General of the DoD, requesting that the Company produce a variety of documents pertaining to the use of
certain cost estimating factors under its contracts with the DoD. The investigation is still in the early stages and no financial demand has been made; accordingly, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what the outcome of this
civil investigation will be or the impact, if any, the investigation may have on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for at November 30,
2011. The Company has and continues to cooperate fully with the investigation and is responding to the subpoena.

Snappon SA Wrongful
Discharge Claims
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a manufacturing facility in
Chartres, France owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company, previously involved in the automotive business. In accordance with French law, Snappon SA negotiated with the local works council regarding the implementation of a social plan
for the employees. Following the implementation of the social plan, approximately 188 of the 249 former Snappon employees sued Snappon SA in the Chartres Labour Court alleging wrongful discharge. The claims were heard in two groups. On
February 19, 2009, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 2 plaintiffs and based on this, the Court awarded 1.9 million plus interest. On April 7, 2009, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued a
decision in favor of Group 1 plaintiffs and based on this, the Court awarded 1.0 million plus interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of
the Paris Commercial Court, and the claims will likely be discharged through those proceedings. During fiscal 2009, the Company accrued a loss contingency of 2.9 million plus interest for this matter.

c. Environmental Matters
The Company is involved in over forty environmental matters under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), and other federal, state, local, and foreign laws relating to soil and groundwater contamination, hazardous waste management activities, and other
environmental matters at some of its current and former facilities. The Company is also involved in a number of remedial activities at third party sites, not owned by the Company, where it is designated a potentially responsible party
(PRP) by either the U.S. EPA and/or a state agency. In many of these matters, the Company is involved with other PRPs. In many instances, the Companys liability and proportionate share of costs have not been determined largely due
to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of site conditions and the Companys involvement. While government agencies frequently claim PRPs are jointly and severally liable at such sites, in the Companys experience, interim and final
allocations of liability and costs are generally made based on relative contributions of waste or contamination. Anticipated costs associated with environmental remediation that are probable and estimable are accrued. In cases where a date to
complete remedial activities at a particular site cannot be determined by reference to agreements or otherwise, the Company projects costs over an appropriate time period not exceeding fifteen years; in such cases, generally the Company does not
have the ability to reasonably estimate environmental remediation costs that are beyond this period. Factors that could result in changes to the Companys estimates include completion of current and future soil and groundwater investigations,
new claims, future agency demands, discovery of more or less contamination than expected, discovery of new contaminants, modification of planned remedial actions, changes in estimated time required to remediate, new technologies, and changes in laws
and regulations.
As of November 30, 2011, the aggregate range of these anticipated environmental costs
was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million. See Note 7(d) for a summary of the environmental reserve activity for fiscal 2011. Of these accrued liabilities, approximately 69% relates to the Sacramento, California
site and approximately 20% to the Baldwin Park Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley, California site. Each of those two sites is discussed below. The balance of the accrued liabilities relates to other sites for which the Companys
obligations are probable and estimable.

Sacramento, California Site
In 1989, a federal district court in California approved a Partial Consent Decree (PCD) requiring Aerojet,
among other things, to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of impacts due to the release of chemicals from the Sacramento, California site, monitor the American River and
offsite public water supply wells, operate Groundwater Extraction and Treatment facilities (GETs) that collect groundwater at the site perimeter, and pay certain government oversight costs. The primary chemicals of concern for both
on-site and off-site groundwater are trichloroethylene (TCE), perchlorate, and n-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The PCD has been revised several times, most recently in 2002. The 2002 PCD revision (a) separated the
Sacramento site into multiple operable units to allow quicker implementation of remedy for critical areas; (b) required the Company to guarantee up to $75 million (in addition to a prior $20 million guarantee) to assure that Aerojets
Sacramento remediation activities are fully funded; and (c) removed approximately 2,600 acres of non-contaminated land from the U.S. EPA superfund designation.
Aerojet is involved in various stages of soil and groundwater investigation, remedy selection, design, and remedy
construction associated with the operable units. In 2002, the U.S. EPA issued a UAO requiring Aerojet to implement the U.S. EPA-approved remedial action in the Western Groundwater Operable Unit. An identical order was issued by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley (Central Valley RWQCB). On July 7, 2011, EPA issued Aerojet its Approval of Remedial Action Construction Completion Report for Western Groundwater Operable Unit and its
Determination of Remedy as Operational and Functional. On September 20, 2011 U.S. EPA issued two UAOs to Aerojet to complete a remedial design and implement remedial action for the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. One UAO addresses
groundwater and the other addresses soils within the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. Issuance of the UAOs is the next step in the

Superfund process for the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. Aerojet submitted a final Remedial Investigation Report for the Boundary Operable Unit in 2010 and the final Feasibility Study for
the Boundary Operable Unit in 2011. The remaining operable units are under various stages of investigation.
The entire southern portion of the site known as Rio Del Oro was under state orders issued in the 1990s from the DTSC to
investigate and remediate environmental contamination in the soils and the Central Valley RWQCB to investigate and remediate groundwater environmental contamination. On March 14, 2008, the DTSC released all but approximately 400 acres of the
Rio Del Oro property from DTSCs environmental orders regarding soil contamination. Aerojet expects the approximately 400 acres of Rio Del Oro property that remain subject to the DTSC orders to be released once the soil remediation has been
completed. The Rio Del Oro property remains subject to the Central Valley RWQCBs orders to investigate and remediate groundwater environmental contamination emanating offsite from such property. Pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into
in 2009, Aerojet and Boeing have defined responsibilities with respect to future costs and environmental projects relating to this property.
As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of anticipated costs discussed above for the Sacramento, California site was $130.7 million to $217.9 million and the accrued amount was $130.7 million
included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable subject to the Global Settlement and Northrop Agreement allocations. Recoverable estimates for this matter are
included as a component of the Companys estimated recoverable amounts from the U.S. Government and Northrop.

San Gabriel Valley
Basin, California Site

Baldwin Park Operable Unit (BPOU)
As a result of its former Azusa, California operations, in 1994 Aerojet was named a PRP by the U.S. EPA in the area of the
San Gabriel Valley Basin superfund site known as the BPOU. Between 1995 and 1997, the U.S. EPA issued Special Notice Letters to Aerojet and eighteen other companies requesting that they implement a groundwater remedy. On June 30, 2000, the U.S.
EPA issued a UAO ordering the PRPs to implement a remedy consistent with the 1994 record of decision. Aerojet, along with seven other PRPs (the Cooperating Respondents) signed a Project Agreement in late March 2002 with the San Gabriel
Basin Water Quality Authority, the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, and five water companies. The Project Agreement, which has a term of fifteen years, became effective May 9, 2002 and will terminate in May 2017. It is uncertain as to what
remedial actions will be required beyond 2017. However, the Project Agreement stipulates that the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach agreement as to the terms and conditions of an extension of the term in the event that a
Final Record of Decision anticipates, or any of the parties desire, the continued operation of all or a substantial portion of the project facilities. Pursuant to the Project Agreement, the Cooperating Respondents fund through an escrow account: the
capital, operational, maintenance, and administrative costs of certain treatment and water distribution facilities to be owned and operated by the water companies. There are also provisions in the Project Agreement for maintaining financial
assurance.
Aerojet and the other Cooperating Respondents entered into an interim allocation agreement that
establishes the interim payment obligations of the Cooperating Respondents for the costs incurred pursuant to the Project Agreement. Under the interim allocation, Aerojet is responsible for approximately two-thirds of all project costs, including
government oversight costs. All project costs are subject to reallocation among the Cooperating Respondents. Since entering into the agreement, two of the cooperating respondents, Huffy Corporation and Fairchild Corporation (Fairchild),
have filed for bankruptcy. Aerojet and the other cooperating respondents have assumed Fairchilds financial obligations. The interim allocation agreement expired, but until recently all Cooperating Respondents were paying in accordance with
their interim allocations.
On June 24, 2010, Aerojet filed a complaint against Chubb Custom Insurance
Company in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
Aerojet-General Corporation v. Chubb Custom Insurance Company Case No.

BC440284,
As part of Aerojets sale of its Electronics and Information Systems (EIS) business to Northrop in
October 2001, the U.S. EPA approved a Prospective Purchaser Agreement with Northrop to absolve it of pre-closing liability for contamination caused by the Azusa, California operations, which liability remains with Aerojet. As part of that agreement,
the Company agreed to provide a $25 million guarantee of Aerojets obligations under the Project Agreement.
As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of anticipated costs through the term of the agreement for the BPOU site
was $38.6 million to $76.0 million and the accrued amount was $38.6 million included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable subject to the Global Settlement and
Northrop Agreement allocations. Recoverable estimates for this matter are included as a component of the Companys estimated recoverable amounts from the U.S. Government and Northrop.

South El Monte Operable Unit
Aerojet previously owned and operated manufacturing facilities located on East Flair Drive in El Monte, California. On
December 21, 2000, Aerojet received an order from the Los Angeles RWQCB requiring a work plan for investigation of this former site. On January 22, 2001, Aerojet filed an appeal of the order with the Los Angeles RWQCB asserting selective
enforcement. The appeal had been held in abeyance pending negotiations with the Los Angeles RWQCB, but due to a two-year limitation on the abeyance period, the appeal was dismissed without prejudice. In September 2001, Aerojet submitted a limited
work plan to the Los Angeles RWQCB.
On February 21, 2001, Aerojet received a General Notice Letter from
the U.S. EPA naming Aerojet as a PRP with regard to the SEMOU of the San Gabriel Valley Basin, California Superfund site. On April 1, 2002, Aerojet received a Special Notice Letter from the U.S. EPA that requested Aerojet enter into
negotiations with it regarding the performance of a remedial design and remedial action for the SEMOU. In light of this letter, Aerojet performed a limited site investigation of the East Flair Drive site. The data collected and summarized in the
report showed that chemicals including TCE and PCE were present in the soil and groundwater at, and near, the El Monte location. Site investigations are ongoing.
On August 29, 2003, the U.S. EPA issued a UAO against Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to
conduct the remedial design and remedial action in the SEMOU. The cost to implement projects under the UAO prepared by the U.S. EPA and the water entities was estimated to be approximately $90 million. Aerojet participated in mediation with EPA,
DTSC and the water entities to resolve the claims, and reached a settlement with EPA and DTSC and the water entities that had filed four separate lawsuits previously discussed under Legal Matters. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court
approved and entered a partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which incorporated settlements with the water entities and resolved Aerojets liability under the
UAO.
On November 17, 2005, Aerojet notified the Los Angeles RWQCB and the U.S. EPA that Aerojet was
involved in research and development at the East Flair Drive site that included the use of 1,4-dioxane. Aerojets investigation of that issue is continuing. Oversight of the East Flair Drive site was transferred from the RWQCB to the DTSC in
2007 and Aerojet has entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with DTSC. Site investigation activities are ongoing.

Toledo, Ohio Site
The Company previously manufactured products for the automotive industry at a Toledo, Ohio site, which was adjacent to the
Ottawa River. This facility was divested in 1990 and the Company indemnified the buyer for claims and liabilities arising out of certain pre-divestiture environmental matters. In August 2007, the Company, along with numerous other companies,
received from the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service a notice of a Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment Plan for the Ottawa River and Northern Maumee Bay. A group of PRPs, including the Company, was formed
to respond to the NRD assessment and to pursue funding from the Great Lakes Legacy Act for primary restoration. The restoration project performed by the group consisted of river dredging and land-filling river sediments with a total project cost in
the range of approximately $47 to $49 million, one half of which was funded through the Great Lakes Legacy Act and the net project costs to the PRP group was estimated at $23.5 to $24.5 million. The dredging of the river that began in December 2009
has been completed. In February 2011, the parties reached an agreement on allocation. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of the Companys share of anticipated costs for the NRD matter was $2.1 million to $3.9 million and the
accrued amount was $2.1 million which is included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable. Still unresolved at this time is the actual NRD Assessment itself. It is
not possible to predict the outcome, timing, or the financial impact of these types of assessments, which are typically long processes lasting several years.
In 2008, Textileather, the current owner of the former Toledo, Ohio site, filed a lawsuit against the Company claiming, among other things, that the Company failed to indemnify and defend Textileather for
certain contractual environmental obligations. A second suit related to past and future Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), closure costs was filed in late 2009. On May 5, 2010, the District Court granted the Companys
Motion for Summary Judgment, thereby dismissing the claims in the initial action. Textileather has appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeal. Briefs have been filed and oral argument is scheduled for March 2, 2012. There are no District
Court ordered dates in the second Textileather suit, but the parties are conducting informal discovery. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated anticipated costs and accrued amount for the Textileather matter was $2.1 million which is included
as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable.

d. Environmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries

Reserves
The Company reviews on a quarterly basis
estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. The Company has an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period,
except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increases, the reliability of such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative
work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs
can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as
the Company periodically evaluates and revises such estimates as new information becomes available. The Company cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for
estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors such as the regulatory approval process, the time required to design, construct, and implement the remedy.

The effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and the Companys
obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. The Company will continue its
efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.
As part of the acquisition of the Atlantic Research Corporation (ARC) propulsion business, Aerojet entered
into an agreement with ARC pursuant to which Aerojet is responsible for up to $20.0 million of costs (Pre-Close Environmental Costs) associated with environmental issues that arose prior to Aerojets acquisition of the ARC
propulsion business. Pursuant to a separate agreement with the U.S. government which was entered into prior to the completion of the ARC acquisition, these costs are recovered through the establishment of prices for Aerojets products and
services sold to the U.S. government. A summary of the Pre-Close Environmental Costs is shown below (in millions):

Estimated Recoveries
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and the former Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be
recovered. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental
expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs
associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to the Sacramento site and former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of
operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because the Company reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to the Companys contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government
contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of
the Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):

The Companys applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the
Northrop Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental
reserve until an arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While the Company is currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop
Agreement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

e. Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
As of November 30, 2011, arrangements with off-balance sheet risk consisted of:
 $67.1 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit expiring within the next twelve months,
the majority of which may be renewed, primarily to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
 Up to $120.0 million aggregate in guarantees by GenCorp of Aerojets obligations to U.S. government agencies for environmental remediation activities (See Note 7(b) for additional
information).
 Guarantees, jointly and severally, by the
Companys material domestic subsidiaries of its obligations under its Senior Credit Facility and its
9

/
2
% Notes.
In addition to the items discussed above, the Company will from time to time enter into certain types of contracts that
require us to indemnify parties against potential third-party and other claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary indemnification to purchasers of its businesses or
assets including, for example, claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination existing prior to disposition; (ii) certain real estate leases, under
which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for claims arising from the use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with officers and directors, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such
persons for liabilities arising out of their relationship with the Company. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated.
The Company also uses surety bonds to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
Additionally, the Company issues purchase orders and makes other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated
requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract is terminated.
8.
Redeemable Common Stock
The Company inadvertently failed to register with the SEC the issuance of certain of its common shares
in its defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan (the Plan). As a result, certain Plan participants who purchased such securities pursuant to the Plan may have the right to rescind certain of their purchases for consideration
equal to the purchase price paid for the securities (or if such security has been sold, to receive consideration with respect to any loss incurred on such sale) plus interest from the date of purchase. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the
Company has classified 0.4 and 0.5 million shares, respectively, as redeemable common stock because the redemption features are not within the control of the Company. The Company may also be subject to civil and other penalties by regulatory
authorities as a result of the failure to register these shares. These shares have always been treated as outstanding for financial reporting purposes. In June 2008, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register future
transactions in the GenCorp Stock Fund in the Plan. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $1.3 million, respectively, for realized losses and interest associated with this
matter.

Operating Segments and Related Disclosures
The Companys operations are organized into two operating segments based on different products and
customer bases: Aerospace and Defense, and Real Estate. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1).
The Company evaluates its operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment operations. Segment performance excludes corporate income and expenses, legacy
income or expenses, provisions for unusual items not related to the segment operations, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes.
Selected financial information for each reportable segment was as follows:

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet
accounts. The out of period adjustments primarily relate to the Company incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for
uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded an adjustment to correct the identified errors resulting in the Company under reporting income by approximately $1.0 million. See
Note 1(a).
(2)
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax benefit and related balance
sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments resulted in the Company reporting $3.5 million and $0.7 million
in additional net income in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively. See Note 1(a).

Discontinued Operations
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. During fiscal 2009, Snappon SA had legal judgments rendered against it under French law, aggregating
2.9 million plus interest related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees of Snappon SA. Additionally, during fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the
Paris Commercial Court (See Note 7(b)).

Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
The Company is providing condensed consolidating financial information for its
material domestic subsidiaries that have guaranteed the 9
1
/
2
% Notes, and for those subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the 9
1
/
2
% Notes. These 100% owned subsidiary guarantors have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 9
1
/
2
% Notes subject to release under the following circumstances
(i) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of any guarantor and
(ii) in the event that the Company attains investment grade status. The subsidiary guarantees are senior subordinated obligations of each subsidiary

guarantor and rank (i) junior in right of payment with all senior indebtedness, (ii) equal in right of payment with all senior subordinated indebtedness, and (iii) senior in right
of payment to all subordinated indebtedness, in each case, of that subsidiary guarantor. The subsidiary guarantees will also be effectively subordinated to any collateralized indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantor with respect to the assets
collateralizing that indebtedness. Absent both default and notice as specified in the Companys Senior Credit Facility and agreements governing the Companys outstanding convertible notes and the 9
1
/
2
% Notes, there are no restrictions on the Companys
ability to obtain funds from its 100% owned subsidiary guarantors by dividend or loan.
The Company has
not presented separate financial and narrative information for each of the subsidiary guarantors, because it believes that such financial and narrative information would not provide investors with any additional information that would be material in
evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees. Therefore, the following condensed consolidating financial information summarizes the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the Companys guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of November 30, 2011, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of November 30, 2011 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the Company;

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
With
the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal
Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
November 30, 2011.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
November 30, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears in Item 8.

Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms
we, our and us refer to GenCorp Inc. and all of its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with
an overview of our business and operations, followed by a discussion of our results of operations, including results of our operating segments, for the past three fiscal years. We then provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources,
including discussions of our cash flows, debt arrangements, sources of capital, and contractual obligations. In the next section, we discuss the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and
judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.
The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the other sections of this Report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report, the risk factors appearing in
Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Report, and the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements appearing at the beginning of Item 1. Business of this Report. Historical results set forth in Item 6. Selected Financial Data and
Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report should not be taken as indicative of our future operations.

Overview
We are a manufacturer of aerospace and defense
products and systems with a real estate segment that includes activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. We develop and manufacture propulsion systems for defense and space applications, and
armaments for precision tactical and long range weapon systems applications.
A summary of the significant
financial highlights for fiscal 2011 which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition is presented below.

Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased to $918.1 million from $857.9 million for fiscal 2010.

Net income for fiscal 2011 was $2.9 million, or $0.05 diluted income per share, compared to a net income of $6.8 million, or $0.12 diluted
income per share, for fiscal 2010.

Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2011 was $115.4 million or 12.6% of net sales, compared to $110.7 million or 12.9% of net
sales, for fiscal 2010.

Segment performance (Non-GAAP measure) before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit plan expense, and unusual
items was $114.2 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $104.9 million for fiscal 2010.

Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 totaled $76.8 million, compared to $148.1 million in fiscal 2010.

Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure) in fiscal 2011 totaled $55.7 million, compared to $131.2 million in fiscal 2010.

As of November 30, 2011, we had $138.4 million in net debt (Non-GAAP measure) compared to $188.5 million as of November 30, 2010.
We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on GAAP. A
reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Managements Discussion and Analysis under the heading Operating Segment Information and Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.
We are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the
global security environment, as well as continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies
across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.

Major Customers
The principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the
purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending.
Customers that represented more than 10% of net sales for the fiscal years presented are as follows:

Sales in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 directly and indirectly to the U.S. government
and its agencies, including sales to our significant customers discussed above, totaled $855.8 million, $786.1 million, and $701.3 million, respectively. The Standard Missile program, which is included in the U.S. government
sales, represented 24%, 26%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The demand for certain of our services and products is directly related to the level of funding of government programs.

Industry Update
For the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ending September 30, 2012 and beyond, federal department/agency budgets are expected to remain under severe pressure due to the financial impacts from
spending cap agreements contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as from ongoing military operations and the cumulative effects of annual federal budget deficits and rising U.S. federal debt. As a result, the DoD budget is expected to
decrease by $21 billion for GFY 2012 relative to the Administration requested level and by $46 billion in the GFY 2013 budget request to be submitted by the Administration in February 2012. The NASA budget will decline by $924 million for GFY 2012
relative to the Administrations requested level and is expected to decline slightly for GFY 2013.
Nevertheless, Aerojet is well-positioned to benefit from continued DoD investment in high priority transformational
systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations in the Middle East, and systems that meet new worldwide threats. The Administration has indicated a
commitment to maintain adequate, albeit lower levels of funding for the DoD than those experienced during the height of conflicts in the Middle East while building defense capabilities for the 21st century. Priority areas that impact our products
include: fully equipping U.S. forces for the missions they face; maintaining situational awareness; preserving air supremacy; maintaining forces at sea; ensuring access to and freedom of space; and developing pragmatic and cost effective missile
defense systems.
In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act took effect impacting GFYs 2011-2013. The Authorization
Act aimed to: safely retire the Space Shuttle; extend the International Space Station through 2020; continue the development of the multipurpose crew exploration vehicle; build a new heavy lift launch vehicle; invest in new space technologies; and
sustain and grow the science and aeronautics programs at NASA. We are well-positioned to succeed among our competitors due to our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing contracts with both traditional and emerging launch providers.
Additionally, we are the main propulsion provider for the multipurpose crew vehicle and plan to compete for elements of the newly announced heavy lift launch vehicle. However, funding levels for both GFY 2011 and GFY 2012 were both below the
authorized level, and we anticipate this trend continuing in GFY 2013.
As a part of the Budget Control Act of
2011 (Public Law 112-25) (the debt-ceiling and deficit-reduction compromise agreement signed into law on August 2, 2011), approximately $487 billion in defense spending cuts

Environmental Matters
Our current and former business
operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes.
Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all
applicable environmental laws and regulations.
As of November 30, 2011, the aggregate range of our
anticipated environmental costs was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million. See Note 7(d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the environmental reserve activity for fiscal 2011.
Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs
are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to
the consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of
operations. However, we are seeking to amend our agreement with the U.S. government to increase the amount allocable to U.S. government contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this pursuit.
The inclusion of such environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government does impact our competitive pricing
and earnings; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.

Capital Structure
We have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of
November 30, 2011 and 2010, we had $326.4 million and $396.7 million of debt principal, respectively.

Retirement Benefits
As of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, our total defined benefit pension plan assets,
total projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation for our qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4 million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA) requires
underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified measurement dates. Our funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for our tax-qualified defined
benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% funding target ratio required under the PPA. The required funded ratio to be met as of the November 30, 2011 measurement

Implementation of ERP System
During fiscal 2010, we conducted a thorough review of the business to assess the effectiveness of our current business processes and supporting information systems. After extensive study and analysis, we
determined that there are many potential benefits from the investment in a state-of-the-art ERP system. The benefits will be achieved through the integration of our data and processes into one single system based upon industry best business
practices.
We engaged a consulting firm to work with us to evaluate which ERP system would provide us with the
best business value while maximizing the long-term benefits. The analysis included multiple factors such as how the system would improve operational affordability, organizational alignment, transactional efficiency, and flexibility to adapt to
future business opportunities. We selected Oracle as our ERP solution and work began on the project in fiscal 2011.
We have committed a full-time cross-functional team of employees to work with our ERP partner and our systems integrator. This team is responsible for ensuring that the system configuration is consistent
with our business requirements and best business practices, coordinating data migration, addressing change management issues, testing controls, resolving implementation issues and developing a user training program. We anticipate the one-time cost
of implementation, both capital and expense, will range from $27 million to $30 million, consisting primarily of software and hardware costs, system integrator costs, internal labor costs, and data migration. We anticipate completing
the ERP project by the first quarter of 2013. Through December 2011, we have expended $10.6 million of our one-time implementation costs of which $9.0 million represents capital.
We expect that the new ERP system will provide reliable, transparent, and real-time data access providing us with the
opportunity to make better and faster business decisions. We expect the integration among various functional areas will lead to improved communication, productivity and efficiency. These improvements should enhance our ability to respond to our
customers needs and lead to increased customer satisfaction. Other advantages we expect to realize by centralization of our current systems into an ERP system are to eliminate the problem of synchronizing changes between multiple systems,
improve coordination of business processes that cross functional boundaries and provide a top-down view of the enterprise.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $27.7
million in the various air-breathing propulsion programs primarily due to the prior years awards on SSST and T3 contracts; (ii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Hawk program resulting in $24.8 million of additional net sales; and
(iii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Bomb Live Unit  129B composite case resulting in $22.2 million of additional net sales. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $22.0 million on the Orion program due to
NASA funding constraints.
**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the
following: (i) an increase of $46.6 million in the various Standard Missile programs primarily related to awards received in fiscal 2009 on the divert and attitude control system contracts; (ii) increased deliveries on the GMLRS
program generating $19.9 million of additional net sales; and (iii) the release of NASA funding constraints on the Orion crew module and service module propulsion program generating $18.0 million of additional net sales. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by a decline in deliveries of rocket motors under the Atlas V program in fiscal 2010 of $21.4 million compared to the prior year.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in costs of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an
increase of $37.2 million of non-cash aerospace and defense retirement benefit plan expense in the fiscal 2010 compared to the prior period. See discussion of Retirement Benefit Plans below. The increase in retirement benefit plan
expense was partially offset by overall improvement in contract performance due to lower overhead expenses and higher sales. The decrease in overhead costs in fiscal 2010 is a result of cost saving initiatives implemented by management.

Fiscal 2009
In fiscal 2009, we recorded a charge of $1.3 million for realized losses and interest associated with our failure to
register with the SEC the issuance of certain of our common shares under our defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan. During fiscal 2009, we also incurred a charge of $3.1 million associated with executive severance agreements.
Additionally, we recorded costs of $0.2 million related to a bank amendment.

Income tax provision (benefit)
$

$
(3.9

$
(17.6

The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to a Private Letter Ruling
(PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing us to revoke our election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. As a result of the PLR, an income tax
benefit of $6.3 million was recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million relating to prior years offset by
$0.1 million of deferred tax expense for fiscal 2010.
The income tax benefit of $17.6 million in
fiscal 2009 was primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year

Discontinued Operations:
On August 31, 2004, we completed the sale of our GDX Automotive business. On November 30, 2005,
we completed the sale of our Fine Chemicals business. The remaining subsidiaries after the sale of GDX Automotive, including Snappon SA, and the Fine Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In November 2003, we announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. In June 2004, we completed the legal process for closing the facility and establishing a social
plan. During fiscal 2009, an expense of approximately 2.9 million ($3.8 million) was recorded related to legal judgments rendered against Snappon SA under French law, related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees
of Snappon SA. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the Paris Commercial Court (see Note 7(b) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Operating Segment Information:
We evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are:
corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and provisions for unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in
understanding our underlying operational performance. Specifically, we believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management
internally assesses operational performance.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $27.7
million in the various air-breathing propulsion programs primarily due to the prior years awards on SSST and T3 contracts; (ii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Hawk program resulting in $24.8 million of additional net sales; and
(iii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Bomb Live Unit  129B composite case resulting in $22.2 million of additional net sales. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $22.0 million on the Orion program due to
NASA funding constraints.
The increase in the fiscal 2011 segment margin was driven by (i) a decrease in retirement benefit expense of $8.3 million and
(ii) favorable contract performance across multiple product lines. These factors were partially offset by (i) higher environmental related costs of $8.7 million; (ii) an increase of $6.4 million in costs on a space contract related to
a test failure; and (iii) an increase in costs of $6.8 million on missile defense contracts related to inefficiencies and a test failure/re-work on rocket motors.
**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the
following: (i) an increase of $46.6 million in the various Standard Missile programs primarily related to awards received in fiscal 2009 on the divert and attitude control system contracts; (ii) increased deliveries on the GMLRS
program generating $19.9 million of additional net sales; and (iii) the release of NASA funding constraints on the Orion crew module and service module propulsion program generating $18.0 million of additional net sales. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by a decline in deliveries of rocket motors under the Atlas V program in fiscal 2010 of $21.4 million compared to the prior year.
The decrease in the fiscal 2010 segment margin was driven by the increase in retirement benefit expense of $37.2 million, partially offset by
higher sales and lower overhead costs.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to segment performance (discussed above), we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational
performance called Adjusted EBITDAP. We use this metric to further our understanding of the historical and prospective consolidated core operating performance of our segments, net of expenses incurred by our corporate activities in the ordinary,
ongoing and customary course of our operations. Further, we believe that to effectively compare the core operating performance metric from period to period on a historical and prospective basis, the metric should exclude items relating to retirement
benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on the earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our operations. Accordingly, we define
Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted by interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefit expense, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective
of such ordinary, ongoing and customary course activities. Adjusted EBITDAP does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

In addition to segment performance and Adjusted EBITDAP, we provide the Non-GAAP financial
measures of free cash flow and net debt. We use these financial measures, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. Management believes that these
financial measures are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our business using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals.

Environmental Matters
Our policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote
a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that
resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.
Estimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these
activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:

accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our
proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and

record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.
In addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring
costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which totaled $7.1 million in fiscal 2011, $8.8 million in fiscal 2010, and $8.4 million in fiscal 2009.

Reserves
We review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. We have an established practice of
estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increase, the reliability of
such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal
proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is
more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise such estimates as new information becomes available. We cannot

The $32.9 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to
the following items: (i) $9.0 million associated with water replacement; (ii) $7.6 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $2.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Fullerton,
California site; (iv) $2.5 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (v) $2.4 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden site; and (vi) $8.8 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $36.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $13.7 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $9.8 million associated with environmental settlements; (iii) $4.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site;
(iii) $1.5 million of additions for remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $1.2 million associated with replacement water; and (v) $5.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $23.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $11.3 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.4 million of increases to the Sacramento site primarily related to increases in operating costs for operable treatment units and environmental
sampling and analysis cost increases; (iii) $2.0 million associated with replacement water; (iv) $2.0 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site; (v) $1.6 million associated with new remediation treatment
facilities; and (vi) $2.2 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The effect of the
final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be predicted with complete certainty due to changes in both the amount and timing of future expenditures as well as regulatory or
technological changes. We believe, on the basis of presently available information, that the resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, liquidity and/or financial condition. We will continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective
remediation alternatives and associated technologies.

Estimated Recoveries
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered.
Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures
eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.
Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its
former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of
fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. See additional information below.
Allowable environmental costs are included as a component of general and administrative costs in the pricing of all
government contracts and allocated to contracts based on government approved cost accounting practices. Aerojets mix of contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through
forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets
commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.

Our applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the Northrop
Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental reserve until an
arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop Agreement, there can be
no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Adoption of New Accounting Principles
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard which requires additional disclosures for plan assets of
defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The required disclosures include a description of the Companys investment policies and strategies, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. As the accounting standard only
impacts disclosures, the new standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard that provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether
paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, we retrospectively adjusted our earnings per share data (including any amounts related to
interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform to the new standard. The adoption of the new standard did not change previously reported earnings per share amounts.
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard related to convertible debt securities that, upon
conversion, may be settled by the issuer, fully or partially, in cash (See Note 5).
As of
December 1, 2010, we adopted the new accounting standards related to the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition that applies to research or development transactions in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving
uncertain future events or circumstances. The adoption of the new standards did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of September 1, 2011, we adopted the FASB amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Previous guidance
required that an entity test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a second step is performed to measure the
amount of the impairment loss. Under this new amendment an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is
less than its carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB
issued updated guidance to improve disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This update requires entities to (i) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and
describe the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately (i.e., on a gross basis rather than as one net number), information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of changes in Level 3 fair value
measurements. The update requires fair value disclosures by class of assets and liabilities rather than by major category or line item in the statement of financial

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The $76.8 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of net income adjusted
for non-cash expenses (defined as depreciation, amortization, stock compensation, tax benefit on stock-based awards, retirement benefit expense, and loss on debt repurchased and bank amendment) which generated $85.6 million in fiscal 2011. These
factors were partially offset by a net cash usage of $9.7 million in noncurrent assets and liabilities primarily related to changes in the environmental remediation recoveries and reserves.
The $148.1 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was due to a $69.1 million increase
in cash provided by working capital (defined as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, contract advances, income tax related, and other current assets and liabilities). The increase in working capital is due to the following:
(i) an increase in contract advances of $44.0 million from prior year; (ii) a decrease in inventories of $10.7 million primarily due to an increase in customer progress payments; and (iii) an increase in

Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities
During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we had capital expenditures of $21.1 million, $16.9 million, and
$14.3 million, respectively. The majority of our capital expenditures directly supports our contract and customer requirements and is primarily made for asset replacement, capacity expansion, development of new projects, and safety and
productivity improvements.
During fiscal 2011, we generated $26.7 million of net cash from the sale of
marketable securities. During fiscal 2010, we made a net cash investment of $26.6 million in marketable securities.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
During fiscal
2011, we had $70.1 million in debt repayments (see below) and $1.8 million in vendor financing payments. In addition, we incurred $4.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendment to the Senior Credit Facility.
During fiscal 2010, cash of $200.0 million was generated reflecting the issuance of the 4 1/16% Debentures in
December 2009, offset by $240.2 million in debt repayments. In addition, we incurred $7.7 million in debt issuance costs and had vendor financing repayments of $1.5 million.
During fiscal 2009, net cash used for debt principal payments was $2.0 million. Additionally, we incurred
$0.4 million in debt issuance costs in fiscal 2009.

On November 18, 2011, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement
(the Senior Credit Facility) with the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Senior Credit Facility replaces our prior credit facility and, among other things,
(i) extends the maturity date to November 18, 2016 (which date may be accelerated in certain cases); and (ii) replaces the existing revolving credit facility and credit-linked facility with (x) a revolving credit facility in an
aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million (with a $100.0 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $5.0 million subfacility for swingline loans) and (y) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0
million. The term loan facility will amortize at a rate of 5.0% of the original principal amount per annum to be paid in equal quarterly installments with any remaining amounts due on the maturity date. Outstanding indebtedness under the Senior
Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, in general without premium or penalty.

Outlook
Short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs
related to our retirement benefit plans, capital and environmental expenditures, and debt service requirements. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating
plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, and interest and principal payments on our debt.
As disclosed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we may be required to make significant
contributions in the future to fund our defined benefit pension plan.
As disclosed in Notes 7(b) and 7(c)
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will
have on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.
Major factors that could adversely
impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates
on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.

Contractual Obligations
We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of debt obligations, operating leases, certain other
liabilities, and purchase commitments. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2011 and their expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods:

The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for postretirement medical and life benefits reflect the
estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. The obligation related to postretirement medical and life benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect
the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
As of November 30, 2011, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $1.5 million. Due to the
uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.
The PPA, as discussed above, will require underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed
intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We may be required to make significant cash contributions in the future to fund our defined benefit pension plan, a portion of which we may not be able to immediately recover from our government
contracts.
We also issue purchase orders and make other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and
supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from
customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract was terminated.

Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
As of November 30, 2011, arrangements with off-balance sheet risk, consisted of:

$67.1 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit expiring within the next twelve months, the majority of which may be renewed,
primarily to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.

Up to $120.0 million aggregate in guarantees by GenCorp of Aerojets obligations to U.S. government agencies for environmental
remediation activities.

Guarantees, jointly and severally, by our material domestic subsidiaries of our obligations under our Senior Credit Facility and our 9

Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for
certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Management discusses those areas that require significant judgment with the audit
committee of our board of directors. All of our financial disclosures in our filings with the SEC have been reviewed with the audit committee. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others
might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are
revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes and litigation matters related to discontinued operations,
which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.
For a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition
In our Aerospace and Defense segment, recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and
estimates related to the contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion requires the use
of significant judgment. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised as necessary. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed include labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of
the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated

Other Contract Considerations
Our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the
U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. government contracts.
For example, costs such as those related to pension contributions in accordance with the PPA that are in excess of CAS allowable pension costs, charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and
therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract
accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are
per-

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair
values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be
recoverable. We evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, we evaluate qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial
performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than
50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of our recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1, 2011, we
evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a
substantial margin. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, we primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and estimates
about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year financial
forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the rates of
return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, we evaluated the results of
the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. We also ensured that the reporting unit fair value was reasonable given the market
value of the entire company as of the valuation date.
There can be no assurance that our estimates and
assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

Retirement Benefit Plans
We have a frozen defined benefit pension plan that previously covered substantially all salaried and hourly employees. In
addition, we provide medical and life insurance benefits (postretirement benefits) to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including administrative
costs, interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.

The discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market
conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and accordingly the funded status of the pension plan. The discount rate was determined at November 30, 2011 for
our pension plans, and is subject to change each year based on changes in overall market interest rates. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched
to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the plans historical investment performance,
its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this analysis, we have assumed a long
term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets
and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be
amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate
used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although
the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.
In addition, we maintain medical and life benefits other than pensions that are not funded.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations

Contingencies and Litigation
We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs
and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any
particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings. See Notes 7(b) and 7(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more
detailed information on litigation exposure.

Reserves for Environmental Remediation and Recoverable
from the U.S. Government and Other Third Parties for Environmental Remediation Costs
For a discussion
of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see Environmental Matters above and Notes 7(c) and 7(d) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a
liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. Management has a well-established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be
estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing
remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote
a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing
technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible
parties will be able to fulfill their commitments at sites where we may be jointly or severally liable.
At the
time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some of our environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of our products and
services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. We consider the recovery probable based on the Global Settlement Agreement, Northrop Agreement, government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving
reimbursement for such costs.

Income Taxes
We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries.
The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.
The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. We have established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of
our net deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits, given historical losses including accumulated other comprehensive losses. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in
the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.
Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that certain
positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference
between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Overview","Overview
We are a manufacturer of aerospace and defense
products and systems with a real estate segment that includes activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of our excess real estate assets. We develop and manufacture propulsion systems for defense and space applications, and
armaments for precision tactical and long range weapon systems applications.
A summary of the significant
financial highlights for fiscal 2011 which management uses to evaluate our operating performance and financial condition is presented below.

Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased to $918.1 million from $857.9 million for fiscal 2010.

Net income for fiscal 2011 was $2.9 million, or $0.05 diluted income per share, compared to a net income of $6.8 million, or $0.12 diluted
income per share, for fiscal 2010.

Adjusted EBITDAP (Non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2011 was $115.4 million or 12.6% of net sales, compared to $110.7 million or 12.9% of net
sales, for fiscal 2010.

Segment performance (Non-GAAP measure) before environmental remediation provision adjustments, retirement benefit plan expense, and unusual
items was $114.2 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $104.9 million for fiscal 2010.

Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 totaled $76.8 million, compared to $148.1 million in fiscal 2010.

Free cash flow (Non-GAAP measure) in fiscal 2011 totaled $55.7 million, compared to $131.2 million in fiscal 2010.

As of November 30, 2011, we had $138.4 million in net debt (Non-GAAP measure) compared to $188.5 million as of November 30, 2010.
We provide Non-GAAP measures as a supplement to financial results based on GAAP. A
reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is presented later in the Managements Discussion and Analysis under the heading Operating Segment Information and Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.
We are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the
global security environment, as well as continuing worldwide economic pressures. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on delivering excellent performance to our customers, driving improvements and efficiencies
across our operations, and creating value through the enhancement and expansion of our business.

The principal end user customers of our products and technology are agencies of the U.S. government. Since a majority of our sales are, directly or indirectly, to the U.S. government, funding for the
purchase of our products and services generally follows trends in U.S. aerospace and defense spending.
Customers that represented more than 10% of net sales for the fiscal years presented are as follows:

and its agencies, including sales to our significant customers discussed above, totaled $855.8 million, $786.1 million, and $701.3 million, respectively. The Standard Missile program, which is included in the U.S. government
sales, represented 24%, 26%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The demand for certain of our services and products is directly related to the level of funding of government programs.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Industry Update","Industry Update
For the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ending September 30, 2012 and beyond, federal department/agency budgets are expected to remain under severe pressure due to the financial impacts from
spending cap agreements contained in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as well as from ongoing military operations and the cumulative effects of annual federal budget deficits and rising U.S. federal debt. As a result, the DoD budget is expected to
decrease by $21 billion for GFY 2012 relative to the Administration requested level and by $46 billion in the GFY 2013 budget request to be submitted by the Administration in February 2012. The NASA budget will decline by $924 million for GFY 2012
relative to the Administrations requested level and is expected to decline slightly for GFY 2013.
Nevertheless, Aerojet is well-positioned to benefit from continued DoD investment in high priority transformational
systems that address current war fighting requirements, the recapitalization of weapon systems and equipment expended during combat operations in the Middle East, and systems that meet new worldwide threats. The Administration has indicated a
commitment to maintain adequate, albeit lower levels of funding for the DoD than those experienced during the height of conflicts in the Middle East while building defense capabilities for the 21st century. Priority areas that impact our products
include: fully equipping U.S. forces for the missions they face; maintaining situational awareness; preserving air supremacy; maintaining forces at sea; ensuring access to and freedom of space; and developing pragmatic and cost effective missile
defense systems.
In 2010, the NASA Authorization Act took effect impacting GFYs 2011-2013. The Authorization
Act aimed to: safely retire the Space Shuttle; extend the International Space Station through 2020; continue the development of the multipurpose crew exploration vehicle; build a new heavy lift launch vehicle; invest in new space technologies; and
sustain and grow the science and aeronautics programs at NASA. We are well-positioned to succeed among our competitors due to our diverse offerings, innovative technologies, and existing contracts with both traditional and emerging launch providers.
Additionally, we are the main propulsion provider for the multipurpose crew vehicle and plan to compete for elements of the newly announced heavy lift launch vehicle. However, funding levels for both GFY 2011 and GFY 2012 were both below the
authorized level, and we anticipate this trend continuing in GFY 2013.
As a part of the Budget Control Act of
2011 (Public Law 112-25) (the debt-ceiling and deficit-reduction compromise agreement signed into law on August 2, 2011), approximately $487 billion in defense spending cuts

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Environmental Matters","Environmental Matters
Our current and former business
operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes.
Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all
applicable environmental laws and regulations.
As of November 30, 2011, the aggregate range of our
anticipated environmental costs was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million. See Note 7(d) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the environmental reserve activity for fiscal 2011.
Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs
are allowable to be included in our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to
the consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of
operations. However, we are seeking to amend our agreement with the U.S. government to increase the amount allocable to U.S. government contracts. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this pursuit.
The inclusion of such environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government does impact our competitive pricing
and earnings; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers.

We have a substantial amount of debt for which we are required to make interest and principal payments. Interest on long-term financing is not a recoverable cost under our U.S. government contracts. As of

As of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, our total defined benefit pension plan assets,
total projected benefit obligations, and unfunded pension obligation for our qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4 million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA) requires
underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified measurement dates. Our funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for our tax-qualified defined

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Implementation of ERP System","Implementation of ERP System
During fiscal 2010, we conducted a thorough review of the business to assess the effectiveness of our current business processes and supporting information systems. After extensive study and analysis, we
determined that there are many potential benefits from the investment in a state-of-the-art ERP system. The benefits will be achieved through the integration of our data and processes into one single system based upon industry best business
practices.
We engaged a consulting firm to work with us to evaluate which ERP system would provide us with the
best business value while maximizing the long-term benefits. The analysis included multiple factors such as how the system would improve operational affordability, organizational alignment, transactional efficiency, and flexibility to adapt to
future business opportunities. We selected Oracle as our ERP solution and work began on the project in fiscal 2011.
We have committed a full-time cross-functional team of employees to work with our ERP partner and our systems integrator. This team is responsible for ensuring that the system configuration is consistent
with our business requirements and best business practices, coordinating data migration, addressing change management issues, testing controls, resolving implementation issues and developing a user training program. We anticipate the one-time cost
of implementation, both capital and expense, will range from $27 million to $30 million, consisting primarily of software and hardware costs, system integrator costs, internal labor costs, and data migration. We anticipate completing
the ERP project by the first quarter of 2013. Through December 2011, we have expended $10.6 million of our one-time implementation costs of which $9.0 million represents capital.
We expect that the new ERP system will provide reliable, transparent, and real-time data access providing us with the
opportunity to make better and faster business decisions. We expect the integration among various functional areas will lead to improved communication, productivity and efficiency. These improvements should enhance our ability to respond to our
customers needs and lead to increased customer satisfaction. Other advantages we expect to realize by centralization of our current systems into an ERP system are to eliminate the problem of synchronizing changes between multiple systems,
improve coordination of business processes that cross functional boundaries and provide a top-down view of the enterprise.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $27.7
million in the various air-breathing propulsion programs primarily due to the prior years awards on SSST and T3 contracts; (ii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Hawk program resulting in $24.8 million of additional net sales; and
(iii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Bomb Live Unit  129B composite case resulting in $22.2 million of additional net sales. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $22.0 million on the Orion program due to
NASA funding constraints.
**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the
following: (i) an increase of $46.6 million in the various Standard Missile programs primarily related to awards received in fiscal 2009 on the divert and attitude control system contracts; (ii) increased deliveries on the GMLRS
program generating $19.9 million of additional net sales; and (iii) the release of NASA funding constraints on the Orion crew module and service module propulsion program generating $18.0 million of additional net sales. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by a decline in deliveries of rocket motors under the Atlas V program in fiscal 2010 of $21.4 million compared to the prior year.

**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in costs of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an
increase of $37.2 million of non-cash aerospace and defense retirement benefit plan expense in the fiscal 2010 compared to the prior period. See discussion of Retirement Benefit Plans below. The increase in retirement benefit plan
expense was partially offset by overall improvement in contract performance due to lower overhead expenses and higher sales. The decrease in overhead costs in fiscal 2010 is a result of cost saving initiatives implemented by management.

non-cash corporate retirement benefit plan expenses. See discussion of Retirement Benefit Plans below. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased by $3.3 million in the current period compared to the prior period primarily due to
changes in the fair value of the stock appreciation rights and stock awards granted in November 2010 and March 2011.

Income tax provision (benefit)
$
6.1
$
(3.9
)
$
(17.6
)
The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to a Private Letter Ruling
(PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing us to revoke our election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. As a result of the PLR, an income tax
benefit of $6.3 million was recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million relating to prior years offset by
$0.1 million of deferred tax expense for fiscal 2010.
The income tax benefit of $17.6 million in
fiscal 2009 was primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year

(iii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Bomb Live Unit  129B composite case resulting in $22.2 million of additional net sales. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $22.0 million on the Orion program due to
NASA funding constraints.
**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the
following: (i) an increase of $46.6 million in the various Standard Missile programs primarily related to awards received in fiscal 2009 on the divert and attitude control system contracts; (ii) increased deliveries on the GMLRS
program generating $19.9 million of additional net sales; and (iii) the release of NASA funding constraints on the Orion crew module and service module propulsion program generating $18.0 million of additional net sales. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by a decline in deliveries of rocket motors under the Atlas V program in fiscal 2010 of $21.4 million compared to the prior year.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in costs of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an
increase of $37.2 million of non-cash aerospace and defense retirement benefit plan expense in the fiscal 2010 compared to the prior period. See discussion of Retirement Benefit Plans below. The increase in retirement benefit plan
expense was partially offset by overall improvement in contract performance due to lower overhead expenses and higher sales. The decrease in overhead costs in fiscal 2010 is a result of cost saving initiatives implemented by management.

The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to a Private Letter Ruling
(PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing us to revoke our election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. As a result of the PLR, an income tax
benefit of $6.3 million was recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million relating to prior years offset by
$0.1 million of deferred tax expense for fiscal 2010.
The income tax benefit of $17.6 million in
fiscal 2009 was primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year

On August 31, 2004, we completed the sale of our GDX Automotive business. On November 30, 2005,
we completed the sale of our Fine Chemicals business. The remaining subsidiaries after the sale of GDX Automotive, including Snappon SA, and the Fine Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In November 2003, we announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. In June 2004, we completed the legal process for closing the facility and establishing a social
plan. During fiscal 2009, an expense of approximately 2.9 million ($3.8 million) was recorded related to legal judgments rendered against Snappon SA under French law, related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees
of Snappon SA. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the Paris Commercial Court (see Note 7(b) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

We evaluate our operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment. Excluded from segment performance are:
corporate income and expenses, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, legacy income or expenses, and provisions for unusual items not related to the segment. We believe that segment performance provides information useful to investors in
understanding our underlying operational performance. Specifically, we believe the exclusion of the items listed above permits an evaluation and a comparison of results for ongoing business operations, and it is on this basis that management
internally assesses operational performance.

Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales was primarily due to the following: (i) an increase of $27.7
million in the various air-breathing propulsion programs primarily due to the prior years awards on SSST and T3 contracts; (ii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Hawk program resulting in $24.8 million of additional net sales; and
(iii) awards received in fiscal 2010 on the Bomb Live Unit  129B composite case resulting in $22.2 million of additional net sales. The increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of $22.0 million on the Orion program due to
NASA funding constraints.
The increase in the fiscal 2011 segment margin was driven by (i) a decrease in retirement benefit expense of $8.3 million and
(ii) favorable contract performance across multiple product lines. These factors were partially offset by (i) higher environmental related costs of $8.7 million; (ii) an increase of $6.4 million in costs on a space contract related to
a test failure; and (iii) an increase in costs of $6.8 million on missile defense contracts related to inefficiencies and a test failure/re-work on rocket motors.
**
Primary reason for change.     The increase in net sales in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the
following: (i) an increase of $46.6 million in the various Standard Missile programs primarily related to awards received in fiscal 2009 on the divert and attitude control system contracts; (ii) increased deliveries on the GMLRS
program generating $19.9 million of additional net sales; and (iii) the release of NASA funding constraints on the Orion crew module and service module propulsion program generating $18.0 million of additional net sales. The increase
in net sales was partially offset by a decline in deliveries of rocket motors under the Atlas V program in fiscal 2010 of $21.4 million compared to the prior year.
The decrease in the fiscal 2010 segment margin was driven by the increase in retirement benefit expense of $37.2 million, partially offset by
higher sales and lower overhead costs.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures","Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to segment performance (discussed above), we provide the Non-GAAP financial measure of our operational
performance called Adjusted EBITDAP. We use this metric to further our understanding of the historical and prospective consolidated core operating performance of our segments, net of expenses incurred by our corporate activities in the ordinary,
ongoing and customary course of our operations. Further, we believe that to effectively compare the core operating performance metric from period to period on a historical and prospective basis, the metric should exclude items relating to retirement
benefits (pension and postretirement benefits), significant non-cash expenses, the impacts of financing decisions on the earnings, and items incurred outside the ordinary, ongoing and customary course of our operations. Accordingly, we define
Adjusted EBITDAP as GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes adjusted by interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization, retirement benefit expense, and unusual items which we do not believe are reflective
of such ordinary, ongoing and customary course activities. Adjusted EBITDAP does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Environmental Matters","Environmental Matters
Our policy is to conduct our businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We devote
a significant amount of resources and management attention to environmental matters and actively manage our ongoing processes to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We are involved in the remediation of environmental conditions that
resulted from generally accepted manufacturing and disposal practices at certain plants in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, we have been designated a PRP with other companies at third party sites undergoing investigation and remediation.
Estimating environmental remediation costs is difficult due to the significant uncertainties inherent in these
activities, including the extent of remediation required, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, evolving technologies and the long period of time over which most remediation efforts take place. We:

accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and when our
proportionate share of the costs can be reasonably estimated; and

record related estimated recoveries when such recoveries are deemed probable.
In addition to the costs associated with environmental remediation discussed above, we incur expenditures for recurring
costs associated with managing hazardous substances or pollutants in ongoing operations which totaled $7.1 million in fiscal 2011, $8.8 million in fiscal 2010, and $8.4 million in fiscal 2009.

Reserves
We review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. We have an established practice of
estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increase, the reliability of
such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal
proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is
more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise such estimates as new information becomes available. We cannot

The $32.9 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to
the following items: (i) $9.0 million associated with water replacement; (ii) $7.6 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $2.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Fullerton,
California site; (iv) $2.5 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (v) $2.4 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden site; and (vi) $8.8 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $36.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $13.7 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $9.8 million associated with environmental settlements; (iii) $4.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site;
(iii) $1.5 million of additions for remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $1.2 million associated with replacement water; and (v) $5.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $23.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $11.3 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.4 million of increases to the Sacramento site primarily related to increases in operating costs for operable treatment units and environmental
sampling and analysis cost increases; (iii) $2.0 million associated with replacement water; (iv) $2.0 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site; (v) $1.6 million associated with new remediation treatment
facilities; and (vi) $2.2 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The effect of the
final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be predicted with complete certainty due to changes in both the amount and timing of future expenditures as well as regulatory or
technological changes. We believe, on the basis of presently available information, that the resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, liquidity and/or financial condition. We will continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective
remediation alternatives and associated technologies.

On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered.
Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures
eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.
Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its
former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to our Sacramento site and our former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of
fiscal 2010, because we reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. See additional information below.
Allowable environmental costs are included as a component of general and administrative costs in the pricing of all
government contracts and allocated to contracts based on government approved cost accounting practices. Aerojets mix of contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through
forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets
commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.

Our applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the Northrop
Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental reserve until an
arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While we are currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop Agreement, there can be
no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

We review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. We have an established practice of
estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increase, the reliability of
such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal
proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is
more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise such estimates as new information becomes available. We cannot

The $32.9 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to
the following items: (i) $9.0 million associated with water replacement; (ii) $7.6 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (iii) $2.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Fullerton,
California site; (iv) $2.5 million of remediation related to operable treatment units; (v) $2.4 million of additional estimated costs related to the Camden site; and (vi) $8.8 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $36.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $13.7 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $9.8 million associated with environmental settlements; (iii) $4.6 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site;
(iii) $1.5 million of additions for remediation related to operable treatment units; (iv) $1.2 million associated with replacement water; and (v) $5.7 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The $23.5 million of environmental reserve additions in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the following items:
(i) $11.3 million of additional operations and maintenance for treatment facilities; (ii) $4.4 million of increases to the Sacramento site primarily related to increases in operating costs for operable treatment units and environmental
sampling and analysis cost increases; (iii) $2.0 million associated with replacement water; (iv) $2.0 million of additional estimated costs related to the Toledo, Ohio site; (v) $1.6 million associated with new remediation treatment
facilities; and (vi) $2.2 million related to other environmental clean-up matters.
The effect of the
final resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be predicted with complete certainty due to changes in both the amount and timing of future expenditures as well as regulatory or
technological changes. We believe, on the basis of presently available information, that the resolution of environmental matters and our obligations for environmental remediation and compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, liquidity and/or financial condition. We will continue our efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective
remediation alternatives and associated technologies.

As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard which requires additional disclosures for plan assets of
defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The required disclosures include a description of the Companys investment policies and strategies, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. As the accounting standard only
impacts disclosures, the new standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard that provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether
paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, we retrospectively adjusted our earnings per share data (including any amounts related to
interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform to the new standard. The adoption of the new standard did not change previously reported earnings per share amounts.
As of December 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard related to convertible debt securities that, upon
conversion, may be settled by the issuer, fully or partially, in cash (See Note 5).
As of
December 1, 2010, we adopted the new accounting standards related to the use of the milestone method of revenue recognition that applies to research or development transactions in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving
uncertain future events or circumstances. The adoption of the new standards did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of September 1, 2011, we adopted the FASB amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Previous guidance
required that an entity test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a second step is performed to measure the
amount of the impairment loss. Under this new amendment an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is
less than its carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The $76.8 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of net income adjusted
for non-cash expenses (defined as depreciation, amortization, stock compensation, tax benefit on stock-based awards, retirement benefit expense, and loss on debt repurchased and bank amendment) which generated $85.6 million in fiscal 2011. These
factors were partially offset by a net cash usage of $9.7 million in noncurrent assets and liabilities primarily related to changes in the environmental remediation recoveries and reserves.
The $148.1 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was due to a $69.1 million increase
in cash provided by working capital (defined as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, contract advances, income tax related, and other current assets and liabilities). The increase in working capital is due to the following:
(i) an increase in contract advances of $44.0 million from prior year; (ii) a decrease in inventories of $10.7 million primarily due to an increase in customer progress payments; and (iii) an increase in

Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities
During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we had capital expenditures of $21.1 million, $16.9 million, and
$14.3 million, respectively. The majority of our capital expenditures directly supports our contract and customer requirements and is primarily made for asset replacement, capacity expansion, development of new projects, and safety and
productivity improvements.
During fiscal 2011, we generated $26.7 million of net cash from the sale of
marketable securities. During fiscal 2010, we made a net cash investment of $26.6 million in marketable securities.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
During fiscal
2011, we had $70.1 million in debt repayments (see below) and $1.8 million in vendor financing payments. In addition, we incurred $4.2 million in debt issuance costs related to the amendment to the Senior Credit Facility.
During fiscal 2010, cash of $200.0 million was generated reflecting the issuance of the 4 1/16% Debentures in
December 2009, offset by $240.2 million in debt repayments. In addition, we incurred $7.7 million in debt issuance costs and had vendor financing repayments of $1.5 million.
During fiscal 2009, net cash used for debt principal payments was $2.0 million. Additionally, we incurred

On November 18, 2011, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement
(the Senior Credit Facility) with the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Senior Credit Facility replaces our prior credit facility and, among other things,
(i) extends the maturity date to November 18, 2016 (which date may be accelerated in certain cases); and (ii) replaces the existing revolving credit facility and credit-linked facility with (x) a revolving credit facility in an
aggregate principal amount of up to $150.0 million (with a $100.0 million sublimit for standby letters of credit and a $5.0 million subfacility for swingline loans) and (y) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0
million. The term loan facility will amortize at a rate of 5.0% of the original principal amount per annum to be paid in equal quarterly installments with any remaining amounts due on the maturity date. Outstanding indebtedness under the Senior
Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, in general without premium or penalty.

Outlook
Short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of recurring operating expenses, including but not limited to costs
related to our retirement benefit plans, capital and environmental expenditures, and debt service requirements. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating
plan for the next twelve months. The operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses, and interest and principal payments on our debt.
As disclosed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we may be required to make significant
contributions in the future to fund our defined benefit pension plan.
As disclosed in Notes 7(b) and 7(c)
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have exposure for certain legal and environmental matters. We believe that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of certain of these matters will
have on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.
Major factors that could adversely
impact our forecasted operating cash flows and our financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. In addition, our liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates
on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Liquidity and Capital Resources/Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities","Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The $76.8 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of net income adjusted
for non-cash expenses (defined as depreciation, amortization, stock compensation, tax benefit on stock-based awards, retirement benefit expense, and loss on debt repurchased and bank amendment) which generated $85.6 million in fiscal 2011. These
factors were partially offset by a net cash usage of $9.7 million in noncurrent assets and liabilities primarily related to changes in the environmental remediation recoveries and reserves.
The $148.1 million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was due to a $69.1 million increase
in cash provided by working capital (defined as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, contract advances, income tax related, and other current assets and liabilities). The increase in working capital is due to the following:
(i) an increase in contract advances of $44.0 million from prior year; (ii) a decrease in inventories of $10.7 million primarily due to an increase in customer progress payments; and (iii) an increase in

During fiscal 2010, cash of $200.0 million was generated reflecting the issuance of the 4 1/16% Debentures in
December 2009, offset by $240.2 million in debt repayments. In addition, we incurred $7.7 million in debt issuance costs and had vendor financing repayments of $1.5 million.

The payments presented above are expected payments for the next 10 years. The payments for postretirement medical and life benefits reflect the
estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect. The obligation related to postretirement medical and life benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis. The estimated payments have been reduced to reflect
the provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
As of November 30, 2011, the liability for uncertain income tax positions was $1.5 million. Due to the
uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid.
The PPA, as discussed above, will require underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed
intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We may be required to make significant cash contributions in the future to fund our defined benefit pension plan, a portion of which we may not be able to immediately recover from our government
contracts.
We also issue purchase orders and make other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and
supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from
customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract was terminated.

"/PART II/Item 5.
Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Critical Accounting Policies","Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP that offer acceptable alternative methods for accounting for
certain items affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, and recognizing revenues.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Management discusses those areas that require significant judgment with the audit
committee of our board of directors. All of our financial disclosures in our filings with the SEC have been reviewed with the audit committee. Although we believe that the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others
might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively and, if significant, disclosed in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The areas most affected by our accounting policies and estimates are
revenue recognition, other contract considerations, goodwill, retirement benefit plans, litigation, environmental remediation costs and recoveries, and income taxes. Except for income taxes and litigation matters related to discontinued operations,
which are not allocated to our operating segments, these areas affect the financial results of our business segments.
For a discussion of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition
In our Aerospace and Defense segment, recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and
estimates related to the contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion requires the use
of significant judgment. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised as necessary. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed include labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of
the work to be performed, availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, warranty costs, volume assumptions, anticipated

Other Contract Considerations
Our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the
U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. government contracts.
For example, costs such as those related to pension contributions in accordance with the PPA that are in excess of CAS allowable pension costs, charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and
therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract
accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are
per-

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair
values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be
recoverable. We evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, we evaluate qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial
performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than
50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of our recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1, 2011, we
evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a
substantial margin. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, we primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and estimates
about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year financial
forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the rates of
return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, we evaluated the results of
the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. We also ensured that the reporting unit fair value was reasonable given the market
value of the entire company as of the valuation date.
There can be no assurance that our estimates and
assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

Retirement Benefit Plans
We have a frozen defined benefit pension plan that previously covered substantially all salaried and hourly employees. In
addition, we provide medical and life insurance benefits (postretirement benefits) to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans, including administrative
costs, interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. We also sponsor a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.

The discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market
conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and accordingly the funded status of the pension plan. The discount rate was determined at November 30, 2011 for
our pension plans, and is subject to change each year based on changes in overall market interest rates. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched
to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the plans historical investment performance,
its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this analysis, we have assumed a long
term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets
and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be
amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate
used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although
the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.
In addition, we maintain medical and life benefits other than pensions that are not funded.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations

Contingencies and Litigation
We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs
and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any
particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings. See Notes 7(b) and 7(c) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more
detailed information on litigation exposure.

Reserves for Environmental Remediation and Recoverable
from the U.S. Government and Other Third Parties for Environmental Remediation Costs
For a discussion
of our accounting for environmental remediation obligations and costs and related legal matters, see Environmental Matters above and Notes 7(c) and 7(d) in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We accrue for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a
liability has been incurred, and when our costs can be reasonably estimated. Management has a well-established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. In most cases, only a range of reasonably probable costs can be
estimated. In establishing the reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Environmental reserves include the costs of completing
remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions, regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote
a significant amount of time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing
technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible
parties will be able to fulfill their commitments at sites where we may be jointly or severally liable.
At the
time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some of our environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of our products and
services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. We consider the recovery probable based on the Global Settlement Agreement, Northrop Agreement, government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving
reimbursement for such costs.

Income Taxes
We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for the Company and our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries.
The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.
The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. We have established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of
our net deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits, given historical losses including accumulated other comprehensive losses. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including our past and future performance, the market environment in which we operate, the utilization of tax attributes in
the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.
Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that certain
positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference
between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the

In our Aerospace and Defense segment, recognition of profit on long-term contracts requires the use of assumptions and
estimates related to the contract value or total contract revenue, the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the nature of the programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion requires the use
of significant judgment. Estimates are continually evaluated as work progresses and are revised as necessary. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed include labor productivity, the nature and technical complexity of

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Critical Accounting Policies/Other Contract Considerations","Other Contract Considerations
Our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the
U.S. government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR and CAS. The FAR and CAS provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable and allocable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. government contracts.
For example, costs such as those related to pension contributions in accordance with the PPA that are in excess of CAS allowable pension costs, charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and
therefore not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract
accounting. We review the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are

"/PART II/Item 5.
Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholders Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities/Critical Accounting Policies/Goodwill","Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair
values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be
recoverable. We evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, we evaluate qualitative factors (including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial
performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than
50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of our recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1, 2011, we
evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a
substantial margin. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, we primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and estimates
about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year financial
forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the rates of
return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, we evaluated the results of
the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. We also ensured that the reporting unit fair value was reasonable given the market
value of the entire company as of the valuation date.
There can be no assurance that our estimates and
assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions and estimates are incorrect, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

The discount rate represents the current market interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle pension obligations. Based on market
conditions, discount rates can experience significant variability. Changes in discount rates can significantly change the liability and accordingly the funded status of the pension plan. The discount rate was determined at November 30, 2011 for
our pension plans, and is subject to change each year based on changes in overall market interest rates. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched
to the expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. We evaluated the plans historical investment performance,
its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from our external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this analysis, we have assumed a long
term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets
and liabilities of our pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be
amortized to pension costs in future years. The accounting method we utilize recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate
used to calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although
the smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual pension costs, future pension costs are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.
In addition, we maintain medical and life benefits other than pensions that are not funded.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations

Policies and Procedures
As an element of our normal
business practice, we have established policies and procedures for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
The objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to make overall borrowing costs more predictable. To achieve this
objective, we may use interest rate hedge transactions or other interest rate hedge instruments to manage the net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings and to balance our fixed rate compared to floating rate debt.
We did not enter into any interest rate hedge transactions or instruments during the past three fiscal years.

Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk principally due to changes in interest rates. Debt with interest rate risk
includes borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Other than pension assets and liabilities, we do not have any significant exposure to interest rate risk related to our investments.
As of November 30, 2011, our debt totaled $326.4 million: $276.4 million, or 85%, was at an average fixed rate of
5.56%; and $50.0 million, or 15%, was at a variable rate of 3.86%.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of GenCorp Inc.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GenCorp Inc. and its subsidiaries at November 30, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended November 30, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2011, based on criteria established in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a. Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations
The consolidated financial statements of GenCorp Inc. (GenCorp or the Company) include the
accounts of the parent company and its wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company is a manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems with a real estate segment that includes
activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of the Companys excess real estate assets. The Companys continuing operations are organized into two segments:

Aerospace and Defense 

Real Estate 
The
Companys fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of the Companys subsidiary, Aerojet, ends on the last Saturday of November.
On August 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its GDX Automotive (GDX) business. On
November 30, 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Fine Chemicals business. The remaining subsidiaries of GDX, including Snappon SA, and the Fine Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations (see Note 12).
Certain reclassifications have been made to financial information for prior years to conform to the current years
presentation. The Company reclassified recoverable amounts from the U.S. government on conditional asset retirement obligations to Other noncurrent assets, a component of the consolidated balance sheets, $12.3 million and $10.7 million
as of November 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was previously reported as Recoverable from the U.S. government and other third parties for environmental remediation costs and other. These reclassifications had no effect on
previously reported net income or net cash flows from operating activities. See Note 3(f).
The preparation of
the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Out of Period Adjustments
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts. The out of period adjustments relate to the Company
incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys fiscal 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. The out
of period adjustments resulted in the Company under reporting $0.6 million in net income in fiscal 2011. Management believes that such amount is not material to fiscal 2011 or previously reported financial statements.
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax
benefit and related balance sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments in fiscal 2010 combined with the effects of the fiscal 2011 adjustments
described above resulted in the Company reporting $2.6 million of additional net income in fiscal 2010. Management believes that such amounts are not material to fiscal 2010 or previously reported financial statements.

b. Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less are
considered to be cash equivalents. The Company aggregates its cash balances by bank, and reclassifies any negative balances, if applicable, to accounts payable.

c. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The accounting standards use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3,
defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The following are measured at fair value:

determined to approximate carrying value.

d. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable associated with long-term contracts consist of billed and unbilled amounts. Billed
amounts include invoices presented to customers that have not been paid. Unbilled amounts relate to revenues that have been recorded and billings that have not been presented to customers. Amounts for overhead disallowances are reflected in unbilled
receivables and primarily represent estimates of potential overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.
Other receivables represent amounts billed where revenues were not derived from long-term contracts.

e. Inventories
Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost method. Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress represent recoverable costs incurred for production, contract-specific facilities and equipment, allocable operating
overhead, advances to suppliers, environmental expenses and, in the case of contracts with the U.S. government, bid and proposal, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of
the U.S. government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to such contracts as a result of performance-based and progress payments. Such progress payments are reflected as an offset against
the related inventory balances.

f. Income Taxes
The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries. The
deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.
The carrying value of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a
substantial portion of

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
its net deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits, given historical losses including accumulated other comprehensive losses. A valuation allowance is
required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including the Companys past and future performance, the market
environment in which it operates, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.
Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, the Company
believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. The
Companys tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial
statements for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial
authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold,
the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities,
adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions
impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.

g. Property,
Plant and Equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Refurbishment costs are
capitalized in the property accounts, whereas ordinary maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by accelerated methods based on the following useful lives:
Buildings and improvements
9  40 years
Machinery and equipment
3  19 years

h. Real Estate Held for Entitlement and Leasing
The Company capitalizes all costs associated with the real estate entitlement and leasing process. The Company classifies
activities related to the entitlement, sale, and leasing of its excess real estate assets as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

i. Goodwill
Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events
occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and 2010, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, the Company evaluates qualitative factors (including macroeconomic
conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it
is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill
impairment test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of
events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of the Companys recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1,
2011, the Company evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying
amount. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Companys Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, the Company primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and
estimates about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year
financial forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the
rates of return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of the Companys estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, the
Company evaluated the results of the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. The Company also ensured that the reporting unit
fair value was reasonable given the market value of the entire Company as of the valuation date.
There can be
no assurance that the Companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect, the Company may
be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

j. Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, and licenses are recorded at cost or when
acquired as part of a business combination at estimated fair value. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized based on when they provide the Company economic benefit, or using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful life.
Amortization periods for identifiable intangible assets range from 20 years to 27 years.

k. Environmental Remediation
The Company expenses, on a current basis, recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and contamination
in ongoing operations. The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases only a range
of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. The
Companys environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions,

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of
time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted
laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill
their commitments at sites where the Company may be jointly or severally liable. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, the Company records an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some
of the Companys environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of its products and services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. The Company considers the recovery probable based on the Global
Settlement Agreement, Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop) Agreement, government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs (see Notes 7(c) and (d)).

l. Retirement Benefits
The Company has a frozen defined benefit pension plan that previously covered substantially all salaried and hourly
employees. In addition, the Company provides medical and life insurance benefits (postretirement benefits) to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans,
including administrative costs, interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. The Company also sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is
available to all employees. See Note 6.

m. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
Conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) are legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and the related asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related assets by the same amount as the liability. Asset
retirement costs are subsequently depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company records period-to-period changes in the CARO liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to
either the timing or the amount of the estimate of the undiscounted cash flows.
The Companys estimate of
CAROs associated with owned properties relates to estimated costs necessary for the legally required removal or remediation of various regulated materials, primarily asbestos disposal and radiological decontamination of an ordnance manufacturing
facility. For CAROs that are not expected to be retired in the next fifteen (15) years, the Company estimated the retirement date of such asset retirement obligations to be thirty (30) years from the date of adoption of the applicable
accounting standard on November 30, 2006. For leased properties, such obligations relate to the estimated cost of contractually required property restoration.

n. Advance Payments on Contracts
The Company receives advances from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. Such advances or
billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings, other than those reflected as a reduction of inventories as progress payments, are classified as current liabilities.

o. Loss Contingencies
The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, has accrued its estimate of the probable
costs and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations or cash
flows for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in estimates or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings.

p. Warranties
The Company provides
product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales. The majority of the Companys warranties are a one-year standard warranty for parts, workmanship, and compliance with specifications. On occasion, the Company has made commitments
beyond the standard warranty obligation. While the Company has contracts with warranty provisions, there is not a history of any significant warranty claims experience. A reserve for warranty exposure is made on a product by product basis when it is
both estimable and probable. These costs are included in the programs estimate at completion and are expensed in accordance with the Companys revenue recognition methodology as allowed under GAAP for that particular contract.

q. Revenue Recognition
The Company considers the nature of the individual underlying contract and the type of products and services provided in
determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. Each method is applied consistently to all contracts having similar characteristics, as described below. The Company typically accounts for these contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method, and progress is measured on a cost-to-cost or units-of-delivery basis. Sales are recognized using various measures of progress depending on the contractual terms and scope of work of the contract. The Company
recognizes revenue on a units-of-delivery basis when contracts require unit deliveries on a frequent and routine basis. Sales using this measure of progress are recognized at the contractually agreed upon unit price. Where the scope of work on
contracts principally relates to research and/or development efforts, or the contract is predominantly a development effort with few deliverable

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
units, the Company recognizes revenue on a cost-to-cost basis. In this case, sales are recognized as costs are incurred and include estimated earned fees or profits calculated on the basis of the
relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Revenue on service or time and material contracts is recognized when performed. If at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract, the loss is recognized
immediately.
Certain government contracts contain cost or performance incentive provisions that provide for
increased or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. Incentive and award fees, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, are included in estimated contract revenue
at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and anticipated performance. The Company continually evaluates its performance and incorporates any anticipated changes in penalties and
cost incentives into its revenue and earnings calculations. Performance incentives, which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally are not recognized until an event occurs.
Revenue from real estate asset sales is recognized when a sufficient down-payment has been received, financing has been
arranged and title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. The allocation to cost of sales on real estate asset sales is based on a relative fair market value computation of the land sold which includes the
basis on the Companys book value, capitalized entitlement costs, and an estimate of the Companys continuing financial commitment.
Revenue that is not derived from long-term development and production contracts, or real estate asset transactions, is recognized when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists, delivery has
occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and payment from the customer is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of provisions for customer pricing allowances.

r. Research and Development
Company-sponsored research and development (R&D) expenses were $27.4 million in fiscal 2011,
$17.4 million in fiscal 2010, and $15.4 million in fiscal 2009. Company-sponsored R&D expenses include the costs of technical activities that are useful in developing new products, services, processes, or techniques, as well as
expenses for technical activities that may significantly improve existing products or processes. These expenses are generally allocated among all contracts and programs in progress under U.S. government contractual arrangements.
Customer-sponsored R&D expenditures, which are funded under government contracts, totaled $276.0 million in fiscal
2011, $283.7 million in fiscal 2010, and $245.3 million in fiscal 2009. Expenditures under customer-sponsored R&D funded government contracts are accounted for as sales and cost of products sold.

s. Stock-based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in the statements of operations at the grant-date fair value of stock
awards issued to employees and directors over the vesting period. The Company elected to use the short-cut method for determining the historical pool of windfall tax benefits and the tax law ordering approach for purposes of determining whether an
excess tax benefit has been realized.

t. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset, or related groups of assets, may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business
climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of
significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If
the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, then the Company would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $1.6 million
impairment charge associated with the write-down of a long-lived asset.
A long-lived asset classified as
held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In the period that the held for sale criteria are met, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for any initial
adjustment of the long-lived asset amount. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of a long-lived asset is recognized on the date of sale.

u. Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign currency transaction (losses) and gains were $(0.3) million in fiscal 2011, $1.7 million in fiscal 2010, and
($1.6) million in fiscal 2009 which are reported as a component of discontinued operations. The Companys foreign currency transactions were associated with the Companys former GDX business, including Snappon SA, which is classified
as discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.

v. Related Parties
A
member of the Companys board of directors is manager of Steel Partners LLC, the manager of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (Steel Holdings). Steel Holdings owns 99% of SPH Group Holdings LLC (SPH Holdings) and is a
beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Companys common stock outstanding as of November 30, 2011. The Company repurchased $15.5 million of its

w. Concentrations

Dependence upon government programs and contracts
Sales in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 directly and indirectly to the U.S. government and its agencies, including sales
to the Companys significant customers discussed below, totaled $855.8 million, $786.1 million, and $701.3 million, respectively. The Standard Missile program, which is included in the U.S. government sales, represented 24%,
26%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The demand for certain of the Companys services and products is directly related to the level of funding of government programs.

and trade receivables. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are held and managed by recognized financial institutions and are subject to the Companys investment policy. The
investment policy outlines minimum acceptable credit ratings for each type of investment and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue. The Company does not believe significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these investments.

Dependence on Single Source and Other Third Party Suppliers
The Company uses a significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government
regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, the Company is often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often
discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. The Company is often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. To date the Company has been successful in establishing replacement materials
and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium
perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry with actual pricing based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the
Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to
require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
The Company is also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw
materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. The Company continues to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products
have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, the Company may not be able to continue to negotiate with its customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The
DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While
availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to the Companys programs.
Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of the Companys key raw materials, difficulty qualifying new sources of
supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, and/or a continuing volatility in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

Workforce
As of November 30, 2011, 12% of the Companys 3,268 employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements. In June 2011, the Company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with substantially all of its covered employees through June 2014.

x. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard which requires additional disclosures for plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The required
disclosures include a description of the Companys investment policies and strategies, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair
value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of December 1, 2009, the
Company adopted the accounting standard that provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in
the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, the Company retrospectively adjusted its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial
data) to conform to the new standard. The adoption of the new standard did not change previously reported earnings per share amounts.
As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard related to convertible debt securities that, upon conversion, may be settled by the issuer, fully or partially, in cash (See
Note 5).
As of December 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new accounting standards related to the use
of the milestone method of revenue recognition that applies to research or development transactions in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving uncertain future events or circumstances. The adoption of the new standards did not have
a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of
September 1, 2011, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Previous guidance required that an entity test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. Under this new amendment an entity is not
required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.

y. New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This update
requires entities to (i) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately (i.e., on a gross basis
rather than as one net number), information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements. The update requires fair value disclosures by class of assets and liabilities rather
than by major category or line item in the statement of financial position. Disclosures regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
in both Level 2 and Level 3 are also required. For all portions of the update except the gross presentation of activity in the Level 3 roll forward, this standard was effective for the Company on March 1, 2010. For the gross presentation of
activity in the Level 3 roll forward, the new disclosures will be presented in the Companys quarterly financial statements for the period ending

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
February 29, 2012. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard will not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.
In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on disclosure of supplementary pro forma
information for business combinations. The new guidance requires that pro forma financial information should be prepared as if the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual period. The guidance is effective for the
Company for business combinations with acquisition dates occurring in and from the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
In May 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures. The new guidance
clarified the concepts applicable for fair value measurement and requires new disclosures, with a particular focus on Level 3 measurements. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be
applied retrospectively. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance.
In June 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance
eliminates one of the presentation options provided by current U.S. GAAP, that is to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In addition, it gives an entity the option to
present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is
effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

z. Subsequent Events
The Company evaluates events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are
issued for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The issuance of financial statements is the earlier of when the financial statements are widely distributed to all shareholders and other financial statements users or filed
with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).

outstanding unvested restricted shares contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Accordingly, the weighted average share balances treat the unvested restricted shares as participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant
to the two-class method. Application of the two-class method had no impact on EPS for all years presented.

The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to the Company obtaining a Private Letter
Ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing the Company to revoke its election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. The revocation is effective
as of the fiscal 2007 income tax return, allowing a deduction on an amended fiscal 2007 tax return of the remaining unamortized balance. As a result of the PLR, an income tax benefit of $6.3 million was

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million
relating to prior years offset by $0.1 million of deferred tax expense recorded for fiscal 2010.
The
income tax benefit of $17.6 million in fiscal 2009 is primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year carryback of tax net operating
losses for refund of prior years taxes. As a result of the clarifying language, the Company recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 an income tax benefit of $19.7 million, of which $14.5 million was for the release of the
valuation allowance associated with the utilization of the qualifying tax net operating losses and $5.2 million was for the recognition of affirmative claims related to previous uncertain tax positions associated with prior years refund
claims related to the qualifying costs.
A valuation allowance has been recorded to offset a substantial
portion of the net deferred tax assets at November 30, 2011 and 2010 to reflect the uncertainty of realization. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized.
A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which the Company operates, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carryback and carryforward
periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company determines cumulative losses on a
rolling twelve-quarter basis and the analysis includes the retirement benefit plan losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on all of its net deferred tax assets except for
the indefinite lived deferred tax assets relating to federal AMT credits and California research credits.
The
Company is routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While it is difficult to predict the outcome or timing of a particular tax matter, the Company believes it has adequately provided reserves for any reasonable foreseeable outcome
related to these matters.

penalties related to uncertain tax positions is $0.2 million. The years ended November 30, 2008 through November 30, 2010 remain open to examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the Companys other major taxing
jurisdictions, the tax years ended November 30, 2007 through November 20, 2010 remain open to examination.

Senior Credit Facility
On November 18, 2011, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Senior
Credit Facility) with the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Senior Credit Facility replaces the prior credit facility and, among other things, (i) extends the maturity
date to November 18, 2016 (which date may be accelerated in certain cases); and (ii) replaces the existing revolving credit facility and credit-linked facility with (x) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
up to $150.0 million (with a $100.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $5.0 million subfacility for swingline loans) and (y) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million. The term loan
facility will amortize at a rate of 5.0% of the original principal

amount per annum to be paid in equal quarterly installments with any remaining amounts due on the maturity date. Outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility may be voluntarily
prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, in general without premium or penalty.
As of November 30, 2011,
the Company had $67.1 million outstanding letters of credit under the $150.0 million revolving credit subfacility and had $50.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility.
In general, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR plus 350 basis points
(subject to downward adjustment), or the base rate as it is defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, the Company is charged a commitment fee of 50 basis points per annum on unused amounts of the revolving
credit facility and 350 basis points per annum (subject to downward adjustment), along with a fronting fee of 25 basis points per annum, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit.
The Company guarantees the payment obligations under the Senior Credit Facility. Any borrowings are further secured by
(i) all equity interests owned or held by the loan parties, including interests in the Companys Easton subsidiary and 66% of the voting stock (and 100% of the non-voting stock) of all present and future first-tier foreign subsidiaries of
the loan parties; (ii) substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property and assets of the loan parties; and (iii) certain real property owned by the loan parties located in Orange, Virginia and Redmond, Washington. The
Companys real property located in California, including the real estate holdings of Easton, are excluded from collateralization under the Senior Credit Facility.
The Company is subject to certain limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and
acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Senior Credit Facility includes events of default usual and customary for facilities of this nature, the occurrence of which could lead to an
acceleration of our obligations thereunder. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facility includes certain financial covenants, including that the Borrower maintain (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (subject to upward adjustment in
certain cases), calculated net of cash up to a maximum of $100.0; and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.40 to 1.00.

a. Plan Descriptions

Pension Benefits
On November 25, 2008, the Company decided to amend the defined benefit pension and benefits restoration plans to freeze future accruals under such plans. Effective February 1, 2009 and
July 31, 2009, future benefit

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
accruals for non-collective bargaining-unit employees and collective bargaining unit employees were discontinued, respectively. No employees lost their previously earned pension benefits.
As of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, the total defined benefit pension plan assets,
total projected benefit obligations, and the unfunded pension obligation for the qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4 million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA)
requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified measurement dates. The funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for the
Companys tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% ratio required under the PPA. The required ratio to be met as of the November 30, 2011 measurement date is 100%. The final calculated PPA funded ratio
as of November 30, 2011 is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012.
In general, the PPA
requires companies with underfunded plans to make up the shortfall over a seven year period. These values are based on assumptions specified by the IRS, and are typically not the same as the amounts used for corporate financial reporting. On
June 25, 2010, the president signed the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (Pension Relief Act) into law. The Pension Relief Act allows pension plan sponsors to extend the
shortfall amortization period from the seven years required under the PPA to either nine years (with interest-only payments for the first two years) or 15 years for shortfall amortization bases created during the years for which relief is
elected. This election could be made for any two plan years during the period 2008-2011. The Company elected the funding relief for plan year beginning 2010 and expects to elect the funding relief for plan year beginning 2011 using the 15-year
alternative amortization.
The value of the unfunded accrued benefits and amount of required contribution each
year are based on a number of factors, including plan investment experience and interest rate environment and, as such, can fluctuate significantly from year to year. Companies may prepay contributions and, under certain circumstances, use those
prepayment credits to satisfy the required funding of the pension plans annual required contribution thereby allowing the Company to defer cash payments into the pension plan. The Company has accumulated $59.5 million in such prepayment
credits as of November 30, 2011. For fiscal 2012, the Company is not expecting to make a cash contribution to the pension plan.
The funded status of the pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plans assets, by any changes in U.S. law, and by changes in the statutory interest rates used
by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements or other plan experience. Accordingly, if the performance of the Companys plan assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the IRS
regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, the future contributions to the Companys underfunded pension plan could be significant in future periods.

Medical and Life Benefits
The Company provides medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Generally, employees hired after January 1, 1997 are not
eligible for medical and life insurance benefits. The medical benefit plan provides for cost sharing between the Company and its retirees in the form of retiree contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance. Medical and life benefit obligations are
unfunded.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Benefits
The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.
Company contributions to the plan generally have been based on a percentage of employee contributions and, prior to April 15, 2009, the Companys contributions to the plan had been directed entirely in the GenCorp Stock Fund. Effective
January 15, 2009, the Company discontinued the employer matching component

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
to the defined contribution 401(k) plan for non-collective bargaining-unit employees. Effective March 15, 2009, transfers into the GenCorp Stock Fund were no longer permitted. Effective
April 15, 2009, all future contribution investment elections directed into the GenCorp Stock Fund were redirected to other investment options and the Companys collective bargaining-unit employee matching contributions are being made in
cash. Effective the first full payroll commencing in July 2010, for non-collective bargaining-unit employees, the Company reinstated in cash its matching contributions at the same level in effect prior to January 15, 2009 and invested according
to participants investment elections in effect at the time of contribution. The Companys contributions to the 401(k) plan were $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, $3.7 million in fiscal 2010, and $2.0 million in fiscal 2009.

b. Plan Results
Summarized below is the balance sheet impact of the Companys pension benefits and medical and life benefits. Pension
benefits include the consolidated qualified plan and the unfunded non-qualified plan for benefits provided to employees beyond those provided by the Companys qualified plans. Plan assets, benefit obligations, and the funded status of the plans
were determined at November 30, 2011 and 2010 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of the
pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs
in future years. The accounting method the Company utilizes recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to
calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the
smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual retirement benefit expense, future expenses are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.

Certain actuarial assumptions, such as assumed discount rate, long-term rate of return, and assumed healthcare cost trend rates can have a significant effect on amounts reported for periodic cost of
pension benefits and medical and life benefits, as well as respective benefit obligation amounts. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the
expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. The Company evaluated the plans historical investment
performance, its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from the Companys external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this
analysis, the Company has assumed a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
The Company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the medical benefit plans. For fiscal 2011 medical benefit obligations, the Company assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase for pre and
post 65 participants in the per capita cost of covered healthcare claims with the rate decreasing over nine years until reaching 5.0%.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations as of November 30, 2011 and on expense for fiscal 2011:

d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy
The Companys investment policy is to maximize the total rate of return with a view toward
long-term funding objectives of the plan to ensure that funds are available to meet benefit obligations when due. The plan assets are diversified to the extent necessary to minimize risk and to achieve an optimal balance between risk and
return. The Companys investment strategy focuses on higher return seeking investments in actively managed investment vehicles with an emphasis toward alternative investment strategies and allows for diversification as to the type of
assets, investment strategies employed, and number of investment managers used to carry out this strategy. These strategies are achieved using diversified asset types, which may include cash, equities, fixed income, real estate, private equity
holdings and derivatives. Allocations between these asset types may change as a result of changing market conditions and tactical investment opportunities.
The Companys pension plans weighted average asset allocation and the investment policy asset allocation targets at November 30, 2011, by asset category, are as follows:

The following is a description of the significant investment strategies and valuation
methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such investments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are
held in money market accounts or invested in Short-Term Investment Funds (STIFs). Cash and cash equivalents held in money market accounts are classified as Level 1 investments. STIFs are not traded on an exchange and active market,
and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments.

Equity securities
Equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and
through a range of market capitalization in common stocks and Common Collective Trusts (CCTs). Common stocks are stated at fair value as quoted on a recognized securities exchange and are valued at the last reported sales price on the
last business day of the fiscal year and are classified as Level 1 investments. CCTs are not traded on an exchange and active market, however, the fair value is determined based on the underlying investments as traded in an exchange and active
market, and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments. Derivatives primarily include options and short equity positions, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Derivatives include
call and put options, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Investments sold short are short equity positions which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1
investments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)

Fixed income securities
Fixed income securities are invested in a variety of instruments including but not limited to government securities,
corporate debt securities, and asset-backed securities.
U.S. government securities are valued at bid
evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 2 investments. Foreign government securities are priced by investment managers using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data,
proprietary models, or indicative quotes and are classified as Level 3 investments.
Corporate debt
securities are invested in corporate bonds and CCTs. Corporate bonds that are actively traded in a robust and visible market are classified as Level 1 investments. Corporate bonds that are valued at bid evaluations using observable and
market-based inputs are classified as Level 2 investments. CCTs are priced by investment managers using observable inputs of the underlying bond securities and are classified as Level 2 investments.
Asset-backed securities, including government-backed mortgage securities, non-government-backed collateralized mortgage
obligations, asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, are valued at bid evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable or unobservable inputs. These securities are classified as Level 2 investments if the
evaluated prices are calculated using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 3 investments if the evaluated prices are calculated using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data, proprietary models, or indicative
quotes.
Investments sold short are short fixed income positions which are classified as Level 1 investments if
they are listed on an exchange and active market, and are classified as Level 2 investments if they are valued at bid evaluation using observable and market-based inputs.

Forward exchange contracts
Forward exchange contracts are not exchange-traded but are priced based on observable input. They are classified as Level
2 investments.

Real estate investments
Real estate investments are interests in real property holdings where the underlying properties are valued by independent
appraisers employing valuation techniques such as capitalization of future rental income and/or sales of comparable properties. If applicable, the properties may also be valued based on current indicative interest received by the Company from
third parties. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Private equity holdings
Private equity holdings are primarily limited partnerships and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in
U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Private equity holdings are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV), which are estimated by investment managers using inputs in which little or no
public market data exists. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Alternative
investments
Alternative investments consist of hedge funds that employ a variety of investment
strategies. These funds invest across a range of equity and debt securities in a variety of industry sectors. Alternative investments are valued at NAV calculated by investment managers using a variety of valuation techniques for the underlying
investments. Since many of these valuations are based on unobservable inputs, they are classified as Level 3 investments.

Commitments and Contingencies

a. Lease Commitments and Income
The Company and its subsidiaries lease certain facilities, machinery and equipment, and office buildings under long-term,
non-cancelable operating leases. The leases generally provide for renewal options ranging from one to ten years and require the Company to pay for utilities, insurance, taxes, and maintenance. Rent expense was $12.9 million in fiscal 2011,
$11.3 million in fiscal 2010, and $11.6 million in fiscal 2009.
The Company also leases certain
surplus facilities to third parties. The Company recorded lease income of $6.7 million in fiscal 2011, $6.8 million in fiscal 2010, and $6.4 million in fiscal 2009 related to these arrangements, which have been included in net sales.
The future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of
one year or more and lease revenue in effect as of November 30, 2011 were as follows:

b. Legal Matters
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings, including litigation in U.S. federal and state courts,
which arise out of, and are incidental to, the ordinary course of the Companys on-going and historical businesses. The Company is also subject from time to time to governmental investigations by federal and state agencies. The Company cannot
predict the outcome of such proceedings with any degree of certainty. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency
amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and are refined each quarterly reporting period as additional information becomes available. For legal settlements where
there is no stated amount for interest, the Company will estimate an interest factor and discount the liability accordingly.
Summarized below are the outstanding matters the Company believes have more than a remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Groundwater Cases

South El Monte Operable Unit (SEMOU) Related Cases
In October 2002, Aerojet and approximately 65 other individual and corporate defendants were served with four civil suits
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that sought recovery of costs allegedly incurred or to be incurred in response to the contamination present at the South El Monte Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley
Superfund site. The plaintiffs claims against Aerojet were based upon allegations of discharges from a former site in the El Monte area. Aerojet investigations did not identify a credible connection between the contaminants identified by the
plaintiff water entities in the SEMOU and those detected at Aerojets former facility located in El Monte, California, near the SEMOU (East Flair Drive site). The cases served on October 30, 2002 were denominated as follows:

San Gabriel Valley Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority v. Aerojet-General
Corporation, et al.

Southern California Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

The City of Monterey Park v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et
al.
The contamination in the
SEMOU was also subject to a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) naming Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to conduct the remedial design and
remedial action in the SEMOU.
These cases have been settled. Under the settlement, the water entities released
Aerojet and the Company from liability for all groundwater contamination in the geographic confines of the SEMOU alleged to have originated from the East Flair Drive site. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court approved and entered a
partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) which also resolved Aerojets liability under the UAO. On August 25, 2011, the Court granted Aerojets motion
for good faith settlement conditioned upon the payment by Aerojet of its second settlement payment on or before December 5, 2011. The Company previously reserved for the settlement and there was no impact in fiscal 2011 to the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The Courts approval removes any contribution claims against Aerojet by other defendants. Aerojet paid the second settlement payment on December 5, 2011 and the Courts Order took effect on December 8,
2011.

Sacramento County Water Agency (SCWA)
On July 1, 2009, the County of Sacramento (County) and SCWA filed a complaint against Aerojet and Boeing
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento,
County of Sacramento; Sacramento County Water Agency v. Aerojet-General Corporation and The Boeing Corporation [sic],  Civ. No. 2:09-at-1041. In the
complaint, the County and SCWA alleged that because groundwater contamination from various sources including Aerojet, McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), and the former Mather Air Force Base, was continuing, the County and SCWA
should be awarded unspecified monetary damages as well as declaratory and equitable relief. Aerojet, Boeing, the County and SCWA reached a final settlement effective October 31, 2011 and Aerojets payment obligations under the settlement
were fully satisfied in fiscal 2011. The Company previously reserved for the settlement and there was no impact in fiscal 2011 to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable subject to
the Global Settlement and Northrop Agreement allocations.

Sun Ridge LLC, et al. v. Aerojet-General
Corporation, et al.
In December 2011, Aerojet received notice of a lawsuit styled
Sun Ridge LLC, et al.
v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.,  Case No. 34-2011-00114675, filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The complaint,

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
which also names McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), was filed by owners of properties adjacent to the Aerojet property in Rancho Cordova, California and alleges damages
attributable to contamination of groundwater including diminution of property value and increased costs associated with ensuring water supplies in connection with the real estate development. Aerojet has not been served with the complaint and is
reviewing the allegations contained therein. In the event the lawsuit is served on Aerojet, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. Since this matter is in the early stages, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what
the outcome of this complaint will be. Accordingly, no estimate of liability has been accrued for this matter at November 30, 2011.

Asbestos Litigation
The Company has been, and continues to be, named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury or death due to exposure to asbestos in building materials, products, or in manufacturing operations.
The majority of cases are pending in Texas and Pennsylvania. There were 146 asbestos cases pending as of November 30, 2011.
Given the lack of any significant consistency to claims (i.e., as to product, operational site, or other relevant assertions) filed against the Company, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate
of the future costs of pending claims or unasserted claims. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued.

Subpoenas Duces
Tecum
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aerojet-General Corporation, entered into a settlement
agreement with the U.S. Attorney in Sacramento, California, acting on behalf of the U.S. of America, in connection with a subpoena the Company received on January 6, 2010 relating to the allowability of certain costs under its U.S.
Government-related prime and subcontracts. In connection with the settlement, the Company paid $3.3 million in fiscal 2011 and agreed not to seek reimbursement for the costs of the investigation and defense of this issue in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2011 (See Note 13). The Company cooperated fully with the investigation.
On September 23, 2010,
the Company received a subpoena duces tecum from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, acting on behalf of the Office of the Inspector General of the DoD, requesting that the Company produce a variety of documents pertaining to the use of
certain cost estimating factors under its contracts with the DoD. The investigation is still in the early stages and no financial demand has been made; accordingly, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate what the outcome of this
civil investigation will be or the impact, if any, the investigation may have on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. Accordingly, no estimate of future liability has been accrued for at November 30,
2011. The Company has and continues to cooperate fully with the investigation and is responding to the subpoena.

Snappon SA Wrongful
Discharge Claims
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a manufacturing facility in
Chartres, France owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company, previously involved in the automotive business. In accordance with French law, Snappon SA negotiated with the local works council regarding the implementation of a social plan
for the employees. Following the implementation of the social plan, approximately 188 of the 249 former Snappon employees sued Snappon SA in the Chartres Labour Court alleging wrongful discharge. The claims were heard in two groups. On
February 19, 2009, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued a decision in favor of Group 2 plaintiffs and based on this, the Court awarded 1.9 million plus interest. On April 7, 2009, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued a
decision in favor of Group 1 plaintiffs and based on this, the Court awarded 1.0 million plus interest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of
the Paris Commercial Court, and the claims will likely be discharged through those proceedings. During fiscal 2009, the Company accrued a loss contingency of 2.9 million plus interest for this matter.

c. Environmental Matters
The Company is involved in over forty environmental matters under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), and other federal, state, local, and foreign laws relating to soil and groundwater contamination, hazardous waste management activities, and other
environmental matters at some of its current and former facilities. The Company is also involved in a number of remedial activities at third party sites, not owned by the Company, where it is designated a potentially responsible party
(PRP) by either the U.S. EPA and/or a state agency. In many of these matters, the Company is involved with other PRPs. In many instances, the Companys liability and proportionate share of costs have not been determined largely due
to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of site conditions and the Companys involvement. While government agencies frequently claim PRPs are jointly and severally liable at such sites, in the Companys experience, interim and final
allocations of liability and costs are generally made based on relative contributions of waste or contamination. Anticipated costs associated with environmental remediation that are probable and estimable are accrued. In cases where a date to
complete remedial activities at a particular site cannot be determined by reference to agreements or otherwise, the Company projects costs over an appropriate time period not exceeding fifteen years; in such cases, generally the Company does not
have the ability to reasonably estimate environmental remediation costs that are beyond this period. Factors that could result in changes to the Companys estimates include completion of current and future soil and groundwater investigations,
new claims, future agency demands, discovery of more or less contamination than expected, discovery of new contaminants, modification of planned remedial actions, changes in estimated time required to remediate, new technologies, and changes in laws
and regulations.
As of November 30, 2011, the aggregate range of these anticipated environmental costs
was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million. See Note 7(d) for a summary of the environmental reserve activity for fiscal 2011. Of these accrued liabilities, approximately 69% relates to the Sacramento, California
site and approximately 20% to the Baldwin Park Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley, California site. Each of those two sites is discussed below. The balance of the accrued liabilities relates to other sites for which the Companys
obligations are probable and estimable.

Sacramento, California Site
In 1989, a federal district court in California approved a Partial Consent Decree (PCD) requiring Aerojet,
among other things, to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of impacts due to the release of chemicals from the Sacramento, California site, monitor the American River and
offsite public water supply wells, operate Groundwater Extraction and Treatment facilities (GETs) that collect groundwater at the site perimeter, and pay certain government oversight costs. The primary chemicals of concern for both
on-site and off-site groundwater are trichloroethylene (TCE), perchlorate, and n-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The PCD has been revised several times, most recently in 2002. The 2002 PCD revision (a) separated the
Sacramento site into multiple operable units to allow quicker implementation of remedy for critical areas; (b) required the Company to guarantee up to $75 million (in addition to a prior $20 million guarantee) to assure that Aerojets
Sacramento remediation activities are fully funded; and (c) removed approximately 2,600 acres of non-contaminated land from the U.S. EPA superfund designation.
Aerojet is involved in various stages of soil and groundwater investigation, remedy selection, design, and remedy
construction associated with the operable units. In 2002, the U.S. EPA issued a UAO requiring Aerojet to implement the U.S. EPA-approved remedial action in the Western Groundwater Operable Unit. An identical order was issued by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley (Central Valley RWQCB). On July 7, 2011, EPA issued Aerojet its Approval of Remedial Action Construction Completion Report for Western Groundwater Operable Unit and its
Determination of Remedy as Operational and Functional. On September 20, 2011 U.S. EPA issued two UAOs to Aerojet to complete a remedial design and implement remedial action for the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. One UAO addresses
groundwater and the other addresses soils within the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. Issuance of the UAOs is the next step in the

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Superfund process for the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. Aerojet submitted a final Remedial Investigation Report for the Boundary Operable Unit in 2010 and the final Feasibility Study for
the Boundary Operable Unit in 2011. The remaining operable units are under various stages of investigation.
The entire southern portion of the site known as Rio Del Oro was under state orders issued in the 1990s from the DTSC to
investigate and remediate environmental contamination in the soils and the Central Valley RWQCB to investigate and remediate groundwater environmental contamination. On March 14, 2008, the DTSC released all but approximately 400 acres of the
Rio Del Oro property from DTSCs environmental orders regarding soil contamination. Aerojet expects the approximately 400 acres of Rio Del Oro property that remain subject to the DTSC orders to be released once the soil remediation has been
completed. The Rio Del Oro property remains subject to the Central Valley RWQCBs orders to investigate and remediate groundwater environmental contamination emanating offsite from such property. Pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into
in 2009, Aerojet and Boeing have defined responsibilities with respect to future costs and environmental projects relating to this property.
As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of anticipated costs discussed above for the Sacramento, California site was $130.7 million to $217.9 million and the accrued amount was $130.7 million
included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable subject to the Global Settlement and Northrop Agreement allocations. Recoverable estimates for this matter are
included as a component of the Companys estimated recoverable amounts from the U.S. Government and Northrop.

San Gabriel Valley
Basin, California Site

Baldwin Park Operable Unit (BPOU)
As a result of its former Azusa, California operations, in 1994 Aerojet was named a PRP by the U.S. EPA in the area of the
San Gabriel Valley Basin superfund site known as the BPOU. Between 1995 and 1997, the U.S. EPA issued Special Notice Letters to Aerojet and eighteen other companies requesting that they implement a groundwater remedy. On June 30, 2000, the U.S.
EPA issued a UAO ordering the PRPs to implement a remedy consistent with the 1994 record of decision. Aerojet, along with seven other PRPs (the Cooperating Respondents) signed a Project Agreement in late March 2002 with the San Gabriel
Basin Water Quality Authority, the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster, and five water companies. The Project Agreement, which has a term of fifteen years, became effective May 9, 2002 and will terminate in May 2017. It is uncertain as to what
remedial actions will be required beyond 2017. However, the Project Agreement stipulates that the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach agreement as to the terms and conditions of an extension of the term in the event that a
Final Record of Decision anticipates, or any of the parties desire, the continued operation of all or a substantial portion of the project facilities. Pursuant to the Project Agreement, the Cooperating Respondents fund through an escrow account: the
capital, operational, maintenance, and administrative costs of certain treatment and water distribution facilities to be owned and operated by the water companies. There are also provisions in the Project Agreement for maintaining financial
assurance.
Aerojet and the other Cooperating Respondents entered into an interim allocation agreement that
establishes the interim payment obligations of the Cooperating Respondents for the costs incurred pursuant to the Project Agreement. Under the interim allocation, Aerojet is responsible for approximately two-thirds of all project costs, including
government oversight costs. All project costs are subject to reallocation among the Cooperating Respondents. Since entering into the agreement, two of the cooperating respondents, Huffy Corporation and Fairchild Corporation (Fairchild),
have filed for bankruptcy. Aerojet and the other cooperating respondents have assumed Fairchilds financial obligations. The interim allocation agreement expired, but until recently all Cooperating Respondents were paying in accordance with
their interim allocations.
On June 24, 2010, Aerojet filed a complaint against Chubb Custom Insurance
Company in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
Aerojet-General Corporation v. Chubb Custom Insurance Company Case No.

BC440284,
As part of Aerojets sale of its Electronics and Information Systems (EIS) business to Northrop in
October 2001, the U.S. EPA approved a Prospective Purchaser Agreement with Northrop to absolve it of pre-closing liability for contamination caused by the Azusa, California operations, which liability remains with Aerojet. As part of that agreement,
the Company agreed to provide a $25 million guarantee of Aerojets obligations under the Project Agreement.
As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of anticipated costs through the term of the agreement for the BPOU site
was $38.6 million to $76.0 million and the accrued amount was $38.6 million included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable subject to the Global Settlement and
Northrop Agreement allocations. Recoverable estimates for this matter are included as a component of the Companys estimated recoverable amounts from the U.S. Government and Northrop.

South El Monte Operable Unit
Aerojet previously owned and operated manufacturing facilities located on East Flair Drive in El Monte, California. On
December 21, 2000, Aerojet received an order from the Los Angeles RWQCB requiring a work plan for investigation of this former site. On January 22, 2001, Aerojet filed an appeal of the order with the Los Angeles RWQCB asserting selective
enforcement. The appeal had been held in abeyance pending negotiations with the Los Angeles RWQCB, but due to a two-year limitation on the abeyance period, the appeal was dismissed without prejudice. In September 2001, Aerojet submitted a limited
work plan to the Los Angeles RWQCB.
On February 21, 2001, Aerojet received a General Notice Letter from
the U.S. EPA naming Aerojet as a PRP with regard to the SEMOU of the San Gabriel Valley Basin, California Superfund site. On April 1, 2002, Aerojet received a Special Notice Letter from the U.S. EPA that requested Aerojet enter into
negotiations with it regarding the performance of a remedial design and remedial action for the SEMOU. In light of this letter, Aerojet performed a limited site investigation of the East Flair Drive site. The data collected and summarized in the
report showed that chemicals including TCE and PCE were present in the soil and groundwater at, and near, the El Monte location. Site investigations are ongoing.
On August 29, 2003, the U.S. EPA issued a UAO against Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to
conduct the remedial design and remedial action in the SEMOU. The cost to implement projects under the UAO prepared by the U.S. EPA and the water entities was estimated to be approximately $90 million. Aerojet participated in mediation with EPA,
DTSC and the water entities to resolve the claims, and reached a settlement with EPA and DTSC and the water entities that had filed four separate lawsuits previously discussed under Legal Matters. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court
approved and entered a partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which incorporated settlements with the water entities and resolved Aerojets liability under the
UAO.
On November 17, 2005, Aerojet notified the Los Angeles RWQCB and the U.S. EPA that Aerojet was
involved in research and development at the East Flair Drive site that included the use of 1,4-dioxane. Aerojets investigation of that issue is continuing. Oversight of the East Flair Drive site was transferred from the RWQCB to the DTSC in
2007 and Aerojet has entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with DTSC. Site investigation activities are ongoing.

Toledo, Ohio Site
The Company previously manufactured products for the automotive industry at a Toledo, Ohio site, which was adjacent to the
Ottawa River. This facility was divested in 1990 and the Company indemnified the buyer for claims and liabilities arising out of certain pre-divestiture environmental matters. In August 2007, the Company, along with numerous other companies,
received from the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service a notice of a Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment Plan for the Ottawa River and Northern Maumee Bay. A group of PRPs, including the Company, was formed
to respond to the NRD assessment and to pursue funding from the Great Lakes Legacy Act for primary restoration. The restoration project performed by the group consisted of river dredging and land-filling river sediments with a total project cost in
the range of approximately $47 to $49 million, one half of which was funded through the Great Lakes Legacy Act and the net project costs to the PRP group was estimated at $23.5 to $24.5 million. The dredging of the river that began in December 2009
has been completed. In February 2011, the parties reached an agreement on allocation. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of the Companys share of anticipated costs for the NRD matter was $2.1 million to $3.9 million and the
accrued amount was $2.1 million which is included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable. Still unresolved at this time is the actual NRD Assessment itself. It is
not possible to predict the outcome, timing, or the financial impact of these types of assessments, which are typically long processes lasting several years.
In 2008, Textileather, the current owner of the former Toledo, Ohio site, filed a lawsuit against the Company claiming, among other things, that the Company failed to indemnify and defend Textileather for
certain contractual environmental obligations. A second suit related to past and future Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), closure costs was filed in late 2009. On May 5, 2010, the District Court granted the Companys
Motion for Summary Judgment, thereby dismissing the claims in the initial action. Textileather has appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeal. Briefs have been filed and oral argument is scheduled for March 2, 2012. There are no District
Court ordered dates in the second Textileather suit, but the parties are conducting informal discovery. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated anticipated costs and accrued amount for the Textileather matter was $2.1 million which is included
as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable.

d. Environmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries

Reserves
The Company reviews on a quarterly basis
estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. The Company has an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period,
except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increases, the reliability of such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative
work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs
can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as
the Company periodically evaluates and revises such estimates as new information becomes available. The Company cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for
estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors such as the regulatory approval process, the time required to design, construct, and implement the remedy.

The effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and the Companys
obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. The Company will continue its
efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.
As part of the acquisition of the Atlantic Research Corporation (ARC) propulsion business, Aerojet entered
into an agreement with ARC pursuant to which Aerojet is responsible for up to $20.0 million of costs (Pre-Close Environmental Costs) associated with environmental issues that arose prior to Aerojets acquisition of the ARC
propulsion business. Pursuant to a separate agreement with the U.S. government which was entered into prior to the completion of the ARC acquisition, these costs are recovered through the establishment of prices for Aerojets products and
services sold to the U.S. government. A summary of the Pre-Close Environmental Costs is shown below (in millions):

Estimated Recoveries
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and the former Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be
recovered. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental
expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs
associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to the Sacramento site and former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of
operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because the Company reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to the Companys contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government
contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of
the Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):


The Companys applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the
Northrop Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental
reserve until an arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While the Company is currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop
Agreement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

Environmental reserves and estimated recoveries impact to the Consolidated
Statements of Operations
The expenses associated with adjustments to the environmental reserves are

e. Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
As of November 30, 2011, arrangements with off-balance sheet risk consisted of:
 $67.1 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit expiring within the next twelve months,
the majority of which may be renewed, primarily to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
 Up to $120.0 million aggregate in guarantees by GenCorp of Aerojets obligations to U.S. government agencies for environmental remediation activities (See Note 7(b) for additional
information).
 Guarantees, jointly and severally, by the
Companys material domestic subsidiaries of its obligations under its Senior Credit Facility and its
9

/
2
% Notes.
In addition to the items discussed above, the Company will from time to time enter into certain types of contracts that
require us to indemnify parties against potential third-party and other claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary indemnification to purchasers of its businesses or
assets including, for example, claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination existing prior to disposition; (ii) certain real estate leases, under
which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for claims arising from the use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with officers and directors, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such
persons for liabilities arising out of their relationship with the Company. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated.
The Company also uses surety bonds to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
Additionally, the Company issues purchase orders and makes other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated
requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract is terminated.
8.
Redeemable Common Stock
The Company inadvertently failed to register with the SEC the issuance of certain of its common shares
in its defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan (the Plan). As a result, certain Plan participants who purchased such securities pursuant to the Plan may have the right to rescind certain of their purchases for consideration
equal to the purchase price paid for the securities (or if such security has been sold, to receive consideration with respect to any loss incurred on such sale) plus interest from the date of purchase. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the
Company has classified 0.4 and 0.5 million shares, respectively, as redeemable common stock because the redemption features are not within the control of the Company. The Company may also be subject to civil and other penalties by regulatory
authorities as a result of the failure to register these shares. These shares have always been treated as outstanding for financial reporting purposes. In June 2008, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register future
transactions in the GenCorp Stock Fund in the Plan. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $1.3 million, respectively, for realized losses and interest associated with this
matter.

Operating Segments and Related Disclosures
The Companys operations are organized into two operating segments based on different products and
customer bases: Aerospace and Defense, and Real Estate. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1).
The Company evaluates its operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment operations. Segment performance excludes corporate income and expenses, legacy
income or expenses, provisions for unusual items not related to the segment operations, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet
accounts. The out of period adjustments primarily relate to the Company incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for
uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded an adjustment to correct the identified errors resulting in the Company under reporting income by approximately $1.0 million. See
Note 1(a).

sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments resulted in the Company reporting $3.5 million and $0.7 million
in additional net income in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively. See Note 1(a).

Discontinued Operations
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. During fiscal 2009, Snappon SA had legal judgments rendered against it under French law, aggregating
2.9 million plus interest related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees of Snappon SA. Additionally, during fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the
Paris Commercial Court (See Note 7(b)).

Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
The Company is providing condensed consolidating financial information for its
material domestic subsidiaries that have guaranteed the 9

/
2
% Notes, and for those subsidiaries that have not guaranteed the 9
1
/
2
% Notes. These 100% owned subsidiary guarantors have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 9

/
2
% Notes subject to release under the following circumstances
(i) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of any guarantor and
(ii) in the event that the Company attains investment grade status. The subsidiary guarantees are senior subordinated obligations of each subsidiary

guarantor and rank (i) junior in right of payment with all senior indebtedness, (ii) equal in right of payment with all senior subordinated indebtedness, and (iii) senior in right
of payment to all subordinated indebtedness, in each case, of that subsidiary guarantor. The subsidiary guarantees will also be effectively subordinated to any collateralized indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantor with respect to the assets
collateralizing that indebtedness. Absent both default and notice as specified in the Companys Senior Credit Facility and agreements governing the Companys outstanding convertible notes and the 9
1
/
2
% Notes, there are no restrictions on the Companys
ability to obtain funds from its 100% owned subsidiary guarantors by dividend or loan.
The Company has
not presented separate financial and narrative information for each of the subsidiary guarantors, because it believes that such financial and narrative information would not provide investors with any additional information that would be material in
evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees. Therefore, the following condensed consolidating financial information summarizes the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the Companys guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Policies and Procedures","Policies and Procedures
As an element of our normal
business practice, we have established policies and procedures for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates.
The objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to make overall borrowing costs more predictable. To achieve this
objective, we may use interest rate hedge transactions or other interest rate hedge instruments to manage the net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings and to balance our fixed rate compared to floating rate debt.
We did not enter into any interest rate hedge transactions or instruments during the past three fiscal years.

"
"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk","Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk principally due to changes in interest rates. Debt with interest rate risk
includes borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. Other than pension assets and liabilities, we do not have any significant exposure to interest rate risk related to our investments.
As of November 30, 2011, our debt totaled $326.4 million: $276.4 million, or 85%, was at an average fixed rate of
5.56%; and $50.0 million, or 15%, was at a variable rate of 3.86%.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of GenCorp Inc.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GenCorp Inc. and its subsidiaries at November 30, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended November 30, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2011, based on criteria established in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a. Basis of Presentation and Nature of Operations
The consolidated financial statements of GenCorp Inc. (GenCorp or the Company) include the
accounts of the parent company and its wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company is a manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems with a real estate segment that includes
activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of the Companys excess real estate assets. The Companys continuing operations are organized into two segments:

Aerospace and Defense 

Real Estate 
The
Companys fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of the Companys subsidiary, Aerojet, ends on the last Saturday of November.
On August 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its GDX Automotive (GDX) business. On
November 30, 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Fine Chemicals business. The remaining subsidiaries of GDX, including Snappon SA, and the Fine Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations (see Note 12).
Certain reclassifications have been made to financial information for prior years to conform to the current years
presentation. The Company reclassified recoverable amounts from the U.S. government on conditional asset retirement obligations to Other noncurrent assets, a component of the consolidated balance sheets, $12.3 million and $10.7 million
as of November 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was previously reported as Recoverable from the U.S. government and other third parties for environmental remediation costs and other. These reclassifications had no effect on
previously reported net income or net cash flows from operating activities. See Note 3(f).
The preparation of
the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Out of Period Adjustments
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts. The out of period adjustments relate to the Company
incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys fiscal 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. The out
of period adjustments resulted in the Company under reporting $0.6 million in net income in fiscal 2011. Management believes that such amount is not material to fiscal 2011 or previously reported financial statements.
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax
benefit and related balance sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments in fiscal 2010 combined with the effects of the fiscal 2011 adjustments
described above resulted in the Company reporting $2.6 million of additional net income in fiscal 2010. Management believes that such amounts are not material to fiscal 2010 or previously reported financial statements.

b. Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a remaining maturity at the date of purchase of three months or less are
considered to be cash equivalents. The Company aggregates its cash balances by bank, and reclassifies any negative balances, if applicable, to accounts payable.

c. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The accounting standards use a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3,
defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The following are measured at fair value:

d. Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable associated with long-term contracts consist of billed and unbilled amounts. Billed
amounts include invoices presented to customers that have not been paid. Unbilled amounts relate to revenues that have been recorded and billings that have not been presented to customers. Amounts for overhead disallowances are reflected in unbilled
receivables and primarily represent estimates of potential overhead costs which may not be successfully negotiated and collected.
Other receivables represent amounts billed where revenues were not derived from long-term contracts.

e. Inventories
Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, generally using the average cost method. Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress represent recoverable costs incurred for production, contract-specific facilities and equipment, allocable operating
overhead, advances to suppliers, environmental expenses and, in the case of contracts with the U.S. government, bid and proposal, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of
the U.S. government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to such contracts as a result of performance-based and progress payments. Such progress payments are reflected as an offset against
the related inventory balances.

f. Income Taxes
The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries. The
deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.
The carrying value of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a
substantial portion of

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
its net deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits, given historical losses including accumulated other comprehensive losses. A valuation allowance is
required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including the Companys past and future performance, the market
environment in which it operates, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.
Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, the Company
believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. The
Companys tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial
statements for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial
authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold,
the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities,
adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions
impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.

g. Property,
Plant and Equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Refurbishment costs are
capitalized in the property accounts, whereas ordinary maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed principally by accelerated methods based on the following useful lives:
Buildings and improvements
9  40 years
Machinery and equipment
3  19 years

h. Real Estate Held for Entitlement and Leasing
The Company capitalizes all costs associated with the real estate entitlement and leasing process. The Company classifies
activities related to the entitlement, sale, and leasing of its excess real estate assets as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

i. Goodwill
Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events
occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and 2010, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, the Company evaluates qualitative factors (including macroeconomic
conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it
is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill
impairment test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of
events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of the Companys recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1,
2011, the Company evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying
amount. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Companys Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, the Company primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and
estimates about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year
financial forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the
rates of return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of the Companys estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, the
Company evaluated the results of the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. The Company also ensured that the reporting unit
fair value was reasonable given the market value of the entire Company as of the valuation date.
There can be
no assurance that the Companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect, the Company may
be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

j. Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks, and licenses are recorded at cost or when
acquired as part of a business combination at estimated fair value. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized based on when they provide the Company economic benefit, or using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful life.
Amortization periods for identifiable intangible assets range from 20 years to 27 years.

k. Environmental Remediation
The Company expenses, on a current basis, recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and contamination
in ongoing operations. The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases only a range
of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. The
Companys environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions,

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of
time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted
laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill
their commitments at sites where the Company may be jointly or severally liable. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, the Company records an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some
of the Companys environmental costs are eligible for future recovery in the pricing of its products and services to the U.S. government and under existing third party agreements. The Company considers the recovery probable based on the Global
Settlement Agreement, Northrop Grumman Corporation (Northrop) Agreement, government contracting regulations, and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs (see Notes 7(c) and (d)).

l. Retirement Benefits
The Company has a frozen defined benefit pension plan that previously covered substantially all salaried and hourly
employees. In addition, the Company provides medical and life insurance benefits (postretirement benefits) to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Annual charges are made for the cost of the plans,
including administrative costs, interest costs on benefit obligations, and net amortization and deferrals, increased or reduced by the return on assets. The Company also sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is
available to all employees. See Note 6.

m. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
Conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) are legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and the related asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related assets by the same amount as the liability. Asset
retirement costs are subsequently depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company records period-to-period changes in the CARO liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to
either the timing or the amount of the estimate of the undiscounted cash flows.
The Companys estimate of
CAROs associated with owned properties relates to estimated costs necessary for the legally required removal or remediation of various regulated materials, primarily asbestos disposal and radiological decontamination of an ordnance manufacturing
facility. For CAROs that are not expected to be retired in the next fifteen (15) years, the Company estimated the retirement date of such asset retirement obligations to be thirty (30) years from the date of adoption of the applicable
accounting standard on November 30, 2006. For leased properties, such obligations relate to the estimated cost of contractually required property restoration.

n. Advance Payments on Contracts
The Company receives advances from customers which may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts. Such advances or
billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings, other than those reflected as a reduction of inventories as progress payments, are classified as current liabilities.

o. Loss Contingencies
The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, has accrued its estimate of the probable
costs and recoveries for resolution of these claims. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations or cash
flows for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in estimates or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings.

p. Warranties
The Company provides
product warranties in conjunction with certain product sales. The majority of the Companys warranties are a one-year standard warranty for parts, workmanship, and compliance with specifications. On occasion, the Company has made commitments
beyond the standard warranty obligation. While the Company has contracts with warranty provisions, there is not a history of any significant warranty claims experience. A reserve for warranty exposure is made on a product by product basis when it is
both estimable and probable. These costs are included in the programs estimate at completion and are expensed in accordance with the Companys revenue recognition methodology as allowed under GAAP for that particular contract.

q. Revenue Recognition
The Company considers the nature of the individual underlying contract and the type of products and services provided in
determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. Each method is applied consistently to all contracts having similar characteristics, as described below. The Company typically accounts for these contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method, and progress is measured on a cost-to-cost or units-of-delivery basis. Sales are recognized using various measures of progress depending on the contractual terms and scope of work of the contract. The Company
recognizes revenue on a units-of-delivery basis when contracts require unit deliveries on a frequent and routine basis. Sales using this measure of progress are recognized at the contractually agreed upon unit price. Where the scope of work on
contracts principally relates to research and/or development efforts, or the contract is predominantly a development effort with few deliverable

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
units, the Company recognizes revenue on a cost-to-cost basis. In this case, sales are recognized as costs are incurred and include estimated earned fees or profits calculated on the basis of the
relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Revenue on service or time and material contracts is recognized when performed. If at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract, the loss is recognized
immediately.
Certain government contracts contain cost or performance incentive provisions that provide for
increased or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. Incentive and award fees, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, are included in estimated contract revenue
at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and anticipated performance. The Company continually evaluates its performance and incorporates any anticipated changes in penalties and
cost incentives into its revenue and earnings calculations. Performance incentives, which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally are not recognized until an event occurs.
Revenue from real estate asset sales is recognized when a sufficient down-payment has been received, financing has been
arranged and title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. The allocation to cost of sales on real estate asset sales is based on a relative fair market value computation of the land sold which includes the
basis on the Companys book value, capitalized entitlement costs, and an estimate of the Companys continuing financial commitment.
Revenue that is not derived from long-term development and production contracts, or real estate asset transactions, is recognized when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists, delivery has
occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and payment from the customer is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of provisions for customer pricing allowances.

r. Research and Development
Company-sponsored research and development (R&D) expenses were $27.4 million in fiscal 2011,
$17.4 million in fiscal 2010, and $15.4 million in fiscal 2009. Company-sponsored R&D expenses include the costs of technical activities that are useful in developing new products, services, processes, or techniques, as well as
expenses for technical activities that may significantly improve existing products or processes. These expenses are generally allocated among all contracts and programs in progress under U.S. government contractual arrangements.
Customer-sponsored R&D expenditures, which are funded under government contracts, totaled $276.0 million in fiscal
2011, $283.7 million in fiscal 2010, and $245.3 million in fiscal 2009. Expenditures under customer-sponsored R&D funded government contracts are accounted for as sales and cost of products sold.

s. Stock-based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation in the statements of operations at the grant-date fair value of stock
awards issued to employees and directors over the vesting period. The Company elected to use the short-cut method for determining the historical pool of windfall tax benefits and the tax law ordering approach for purposes of determining whether an
excess tax benefit has been realized.

t. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset, or related groups of assets, may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business
climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of
significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If
the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, then the Company would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $1.6 million
impairment charge associated with the write-down of a long-lived asset.
A long-lived asset classified as
held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In the period that the held for sale criteria are met, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for any initial
adjustment of the long-lived asset amount. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of a long-lived asset is recognized on the date of sale.

u. Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign currency transaction (losses) and gains were $(0.3) million in fiscal 2011, $1.7 million in fiscal 2010, and
($1.6) million in fiscal 2009 which are reported as a component of discontinued operations. The Companys foreign currency transactions were associated with the Companys former GDX business, including Snappon SA, which is classified
as discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.

v. Related Parties
A
member of the Companys board of directors is manager of Steel Partners LLC, the manager of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (Steel Holdings). Steel Holdings owns 99% of SPH Group Holdings LLC (SPH Holdings) and is a
beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Companys common stock outstanding as of November 30, 2011. The Company repurchased $15.5 million of its

w. Concentrations

Dependence upon government programs and contracts
Sales in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 directly and indirectly to the U.S. government and its agencies, including sales
to the Companys significant customers discussed below, totaled $855.8 million, $786.1 million, and $701.3 million, respectively. The Standard Missile program, which is included in the U.S. government sales, represented 24%,
26%, and 22% of net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The demand for certain of the Companys services and products is directly related to the level of funding of government programs.

Less than 10%.

Dependence on Single Source and Other Third Party Suppliers
The Company uses a significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government
regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, the Company is often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often
discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. The Company is often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. To date the Company has been successful in establishing replacement materials
and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium
perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry with actual pricing based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the
Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to
require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
The Company is also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw
materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. The Company continues to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products
have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, the Company may not be able to continue to negotiate with its customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The
DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While
availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to the Companys programs.
Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of the Companys key raw materials, difficulty qualifying new sources of
supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, and/or a continuing volatility in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

Workforce
As of November 30, 2011, 12% of the Companys 3,268 employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements. In June 2011, the Company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with substantially all of its covered employees through June 2014.

x. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard which requires additional disclosures for plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The required
disclosures include a description of the Companys investment policies and strategies, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair
value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of December 1, 2009, the
Company adopted the accounting standard that provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in
the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, the Company retrospectively adjusted its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial
data) to conform to the new standard. The adoption of the new standard did not change previously reported earnings per share amounts.
As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard related to convertible debt securities that, upon conversion, may be settled by the issuer, fully or partially, in cash (See
Note 5).
As of December 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new accounting standards related to the use
of the milestone method of revenue recognition that applies to research or development transactions in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving uncertain future events or circumstances. The adoption of the new standards did not have
a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of
September 1, 2011, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Previous guidance required that an entity test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. Under this new amendment an entity is not
required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.

y. New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This update
requires entities to (i) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately (i.e., on a gross basis
rather than as one net number), information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements. The update requires fair value disclosures by class of assets and liabilities rather
than by major category or line item in the statement of financial position. Disclosures regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
in both Level 2 and Level 3 are also required. For all portions of the update except the gross presentation of activity in the Level 3 roll forward, this standard was effective for the Company on March 1, 2010. For the gross presentation of
activity in the Level 3 roll forward, the new disclosures will be presented in the Companys quarterly financial statements for the period ending

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
February 29, 2012. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard will not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.
In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on disclosure of supplementary pro forma
information for business combinations. The new guidance requires that pro forma financial information should be prepared as if the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual period. The guidance is effective for the
Company for business combinations with acquisition dates occurring in and from the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
In May 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures. The new guidance
clarified the concepts applicable for fair value measurement and requires new disclosures, with a particular focus on Level 3 measurements. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be
applied retrospectively. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance.
In June 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance
eliminates one of the presentation options provided by current U.S. GAAP, that is to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In addition, it gives an entity the option to
present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is
effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

z. Subsequent Events
The Company evaluates events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are
issued for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The issuance of financial statements is the earlier of when the financial statements are widely distributed to all shareholders and other financial statements users or filed
with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).

The undistributed income allocated to participating securities was less than $0.1 million for all years presented. The Companys
outstanding unvested restricted shares contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Accordingly, the weighted average share balances treat the unvested restricted shares as participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant
to the two-class method. Application of the two-class method had no impact on EPS for all years presented.

The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to the Company obtaining a Private Letter
Ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing the Company to revoke its election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. The revocation is effective
as of the fiscal 2007 income tax return, allowing a deduction on an amended fiscal 2007 tax return of the remaining unamortized balance. As a result of the PLR, an income tax benefit of $6.3 million was

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million
relating to prior years offset by $0.1 million of deferred tax expense recorded for fiscal 2010.
The
income tax benefit of $17.6 million in fiscal 2009 is primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year carryback of tax net operating
losses for refund of prior years taxes. As a result of the clarifying language, the Company recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 an income tax benefit of $19.7 million, of which $14.5 million was for the release of the
valuation allowance associated with the utilization of the qualifying tax net operating losses and $5.2 million was for the recognition of affirmative claims related to previous uncertain tax positions associated with prior years refund
claims related to the qualifying costs.
A valuation allowance has been recorded to offset a substantial
portion of the net deferred tax assets at November 30, 2011 and 2010 to reflect the uncertainty of realization. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized.
A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which the Company operates, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carryback and carryforward
periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company determines cumulative losses on a
rolling twelve-quarter basis and the analysis includes the retirement benefit plan losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on all of its net deferred tax assets except for
the indefinite lived deferred tax assets relating to federal AMT credits and California research credits.
The
Company is routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While it is difficult to predict the outcome or timing of a particular tax matter, the Company believes it has adequately provided reserves for any reasonable foreseeable outcome
related to these matters.

penalties related to uncertain tax positions is $0.2 million. The years ended November 30, 2008 through November 30, 2010 remain open to examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For the Companys other major taxing
jurisdictions, the tax years ended November 30, 2007 through November 20, 2010 remain open to examination.

Senior Credit Facility
On November 18, 2011, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Senior
Credit Facility) with the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Senior Credit Facility replaces the prior credit facility and, among other things, (i) extends the maturity
date to November 18, 2016 (which date may be accelerated in certain cases); and (ii) replaces the existing revolving credit facility and credit-linked facility with (x) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
up to $150.0 million (with a $100.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $5.0 million subfacility for swingline loans) and (y) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million. The term loan
facility will amortize at a rate of 5.0% of the original principal

amount per annum to be paid in equal quarterly installments with any remaining amounts due on the maturity date. Outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility may be voluntarily
prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, in general without premium or penalty.
As of November 30, 2011,
the Company had $67.1 million outstanding letters of credit under the $150.0 million revolving credit subfacility and had $50.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility.
In general, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR plus 350 basis points
(subject to downward adjustment), or the base rate as it is defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, the Company is charged a commitment fee of 50 basis points per annum on unused amounts of the revolving
credit facility and 350 basis points per annum (subject to downward adjustment), along with a fronting fee of 25 basis points per annum, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit.
The Company guarantees the payment obligations under the Senior Credit Facility. Any borrowings are further secured by
(i) all equity interests owned or held by the loan parties, including interests in the Companys Easton subsidiary and 66% of the voting stock (and 100% of the non-voting stock) of all present and future first-tier foreign subsidiaries of
the loan parties; (ii) substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property and assets of the loan parties; and (iii) certain real property owned by the loan parties located in Orange, Virginia and Redmond, Washington. The
Companys real property located in California, including the real estate holdings of Easton, are excluded from collateralization under the Senior Credit Facility.
The Company is subject to certain limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and
acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Senior Credit Facility includes events of default usual and customary for facilities of this nature, the occurrence of which could lead to an
acceleration of our obligations thereunder. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facility includes certain financial covenants, including that the Borrower maintain (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (subject to upward adjustment in
certain cases), calculated net of cash up to a maximum of $100.0; and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.40 to 1.00.

a. Plan Descriptions

Pension Benefits
On November 25, 2008, the Company decided to amend the defined benefit pension and benefits restoration plans to freeze future accruals under such plans. Effective February 1, 2009 and
July 31, 2009, future benefit

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
accruals for non-collective bargaining-unit employees and collective bargaining unit employees were discontinued, respectively. No employees lost their previously earned pension benefits.
As of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, the total defined benefit pension plan assets,
total projected benefit obligations, and the unfunded pension obligation for the qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4 million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA)
requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified measurement dates. The funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for the
Companys tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% ratio required under the PPA. The required ratio to be met as of the November 30, 2011 measurement date is 100%. The final calculated PPA funded ratio
as of November 30, 2011 is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012.
In general, the PPA
requires companies with underfunded plans to make up the shortfall over a seven year period. These values are based on assumptions specified by the IRS, and are typically not the same as the amounts used for corporate financial reporting. On
June 25, 2010, the president signed the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (Pension Relief Act) into law. The Pension Relief Act allows pension plan sponsors to extend the
shortfall amortization period from the seven years required under the PPA to either nine years (with interest-only payments for the first two years) or 15 years for shortfall amortization bases created during the years for which relief is
elected. This election could be made for any two plan years during the period 2008-2011. The Company elected the funding relief for plan year beginning 2010 and expects to elect the funding relief for plan year beginning 2011 using the 15-year
alternative amortization.
The value of the unfunded accrued benefits and amount of required contribution each
year are based on a number of factors, including plan investment experience and interest rate environment and, as such, can fluctuate significantly from year to year. Companies may prepay contributions and, under certain circumstances, use those
prepayment credits to satisfy the required funding of the pension plans annual required contribution thereby allowing the Company to defer cash payments into the pension plan. The Company has accumulated $59.5 million in such prepayment
credits as of November 30, 2011. For fiscal 2012, the Company is not expecting to make a cash contribution to the pension plan.
The funded status of the pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plans assets, by any changes in U.S. law, and by changes in the statutory interest rates used
by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements or other plan experience. Accordingly, if the performance of the Companys plan assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the IRS
regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, the future contributions to the Companys underfunded pension plan could be significant in future periods.

Medical and Life Benefits
The Company provides medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Generally, employees hired after January 1, 1997 are not
eligible for medical and life insurance benefits. The medical benefit plan provides for cost sharing between the Company and its retirees in the form of retiree contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance. Medical and life benefit obligations are
unfunded.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Benefits
The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.
Company contributions to the plan generally have been based on a percentage of employee contributions and, prior to April 15, 2009, the Companys contributions to the plan had been directed entirely in the GenCorp Stock Fund. Effective
January 15, 2009, the Company discontinued the employer matching component

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
to the defined contribution 401(k) plan for non-collective bargaining-unit employees. Effective March 15, 2009, transfers into the GenCorp Stock Fund were no longer permitted. Effective
April 15, 2009, all future contribution investment elections directed into the GenCorp Stock Fund were redirected to other investment options and the Companys collective bargaining-unit employee matching contributions are being made in
cash. Effective the first full payroll commencing in July 2010, for non-collective bargaining-unit employees, the Company reinstated in cash its matching contributions at the same level in effect prior to January 15, 2009 and invested according
to participants investment elections in effect at the time of contribution. The Companys contributions to the 401(k) plan were $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, $3.7 million in fiscal 2010, and $2.0 million in fiscal 2009.

b. Plan Results
Summarized below is the balance sheet impact of the Companys pension benefits and medical and life benefits. Pension
benefits include the consolidated qualified plan and the unfunded non-qualified plan for benefits provided to employees beyond those provided by the Companys qualified plans. Plan assets, benefit obligations, and the funded status of the plans
were determined at November 30, 2011 and 2010 for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of the
pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs
in future years. The accounting method the Company utilizes recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to
calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the
smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual retirement benefit expense, future expenses are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.

pension benefits and medical and life benefits, as well as respective benefit obligation amounts. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the
expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. The Company evaluated the plans historical investment
performance, its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from the Companys external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this
analysis, the Company has assumed a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
The Company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the medical benefit plans. For fiscal 2011 medical benefit obligations, the Company assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase for pre and
post 65 participants in the per capita cost of covered healthcare claims with the rate decreasing over nine years until reaching 5.0%.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations as of November 30, 2011 and on expense for fiscal 2011:

d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy
The Companys investment policy is to maximize the total rate of return with a view toward
long-term funding objectives of the plan to ensure that funds are available to meet benefit obligations when due. The plan assets are diversified to the extent necessary to minimize risk and to achieve an optimal balance between risk and
return. The Companys investment strategy focuses on higher return seeking investments in actively managed investment vehicles with an emphasis toward alternative investment strategies and allows for diversification as to the type of
assets, investment strategies employed, and number of investment managers used to carry out this strategy. These strategies are achieved using diversified asset types, which may include cash, equities, fixed income, real estate, private equity
holdings and derivatives. Allocations between these asset types may change as a result of changing market conditions and tactical investment opportunities.
The Companys pension plans weighted average asset allocation and the investment policy asset allocation targets at November 30, 2011, by asset category, are as follows:

The following is a description of the significant investment strategies and valuation
methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such investments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are
held in money market accounts or invested in Short-Term Investment Funds (STIFs). Cash and cash equivalents held in money market accounts are classified as Level 1 investments. STIFs are not traded on an exchange and active market,
and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments.

Equity securities
Equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and
through a range of market capitalization in common stocks and Common Collective Trusts (CCTs). Common stocks are stated at fair value as quoted on a recognized securities exchange and are valued at the last reported sales price on the
last business day of the fiscal year and are classified as Level 1 investments. CCTs are not traded on an exchange and active market, however, the fair value is determined based on the underlying investments as traded in an exchange and active
market, and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments. Derivatives primarily include options and short equity positions, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Derivatives include
call and put options, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Investments sold short are short equity positions which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1
investments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)

Fixed income securities
Fixed income securities are invested in a variety of instruments including but not limited to government securities,
corporate debt securities, and asset-backed securities.
U.S. government securities are valued at bid
evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 2 investments. Foreign government securities are priced by investment managers using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data,
proprietary models, or indicative quotes and are classified as Level 3 investments.
Corporate debt
securities are invested in corporate bonds and CCTs. Corporate bonds that are actively traded in a robust and visible market are classified as Level 1 investments. Corporate bonds that are valued at bid evaluations using observable and
market-based inputs are classified as Level 2 investments. CCTs are priced by investment managers using observable inputs of the underlying bond securities and are classified as Level 2 investments.
Asset-backed securities, including government-backed mortgage securities, non-government-backed collateralized mortgage
obligations, asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, are valued at bid evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable or unobservable inputs. These securities are classified as Level 2 investments if the
evaluated prices are calculated using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 3 investments if the evaluated prices are calculated using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data, proprietary models, or indicative
quotes.
Investments sold short are short fixed income positions which are classified as Level 1 investments if
they are listed on an exchange and active market, and are classified as Level 2 investments if they are valued at bid evaluation using observable and market-based inputs.

Forward exchange contracts
Forward exchange contracts are not exchange-traded but are priced based on observable input. They are classified as Level
2 investments.

Real estate investments
Real estate investments are interests in real property holdings where the underlying properties are valued by independent
appraisers employing valuation techniques such as capitalization of future rental income and/or sales of comparable properties. If applicable, the properties may also be valued based on current indicative interest received by the Company from
third parties. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Private equity holdings
Private equity holdings are primarily limited partnerships and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in
U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Private equity holdings are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV), which are estimated by investment managers using inputs in which little or no
public market data exists. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Alternative
investments
Alternative investments consist of hedge funds that employ a variety of investment
strategies. These funds invest across a range of equity and debt securities in a variety of industry sectors. Alternative investments are valued at NAV calculated by investment managers using a variety of valuation techniques for the underlying
investments. Since many of these valuations are based on unobservable inputs, they are classified as Level 3 investments.

Commitments and Contingencies

a. Lease Commitments and Income
The Company and its subsidiaries lease certain facilities, machinery and equipment, and office buildings under long-term,
non-cancelable operating leases. The leases generally provide for renewal options ranging from one to ten years and require the Company to pay for utilities, insurance, taxes, and maintenance. Rent expense was $12.9 million in fiscal 2011,
$11.3 million in fiscal 2010, and $11.6 million in fiscal 2009.
The Company also leases certain
surplus facilities to third parties. The Company recorded lease income of $6.7 million in fiscal 2011, $6.8 million in fiscal 2010, and $6.4 million in fiscal 2009 related to these arrangements, which have been included in net sales.
The future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of
one year or more and lease revenue in effect as of November 30, 2011 were as follows:

b. Legal Matters
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings, including litigation in U.S. federal and state courts,
which arise out of, and are incidental to, the ordinary course of the Companys on-going and historical businesses. The Company is also subject from time to time to governmental investigations by federal and state agencies. The Company cannot
predict the outcome of such proceedings with any degree of certainty. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency
amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and are refined each quarterly reporting period as additional information becomes available. For legal settlements where
there is no stated amount for interest, the Company will estimate an interest factor and discount the liability accordingly.
Summarized below are the outstanding matters the Company believes have more than a remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

Shareholders of GenCorp Inc.:","To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of GenCorp Inc.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of GenCorp Inc. and its subsidiaries at November 30, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended November 30, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2011, based on criteria established in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule,
and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The consolidated financial statements of GenCorp Inc. (GenCorp or the Company) include the
accounts of the parent company and its wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company is a manufacturer of aerospace and defense products and systems with a real estate segment that includes
activities related to the re-zoning, entitlement, sale, and leasing of the Companys excess real estate assets. The Companys continuing operations are organized into two segments:

Aerospace and Defense 

Real Estate 
The
Companys fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. The fiscal year of the Companys subsidiary, Aerojet, ends on the last Saturday of November.
On August 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its GDX Automotive (GDX) business. On
November 30, 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Fine Chemicals business. The remaining subsidiaries of GDX, including Snappon SA, and the Fine Chemicals business are classified as discontinued operations (see Note 12).
Certain reclassifications have been made to financial information for prior years to conform to the current years
presentation. The Company reclassified recoverable amounts from the U.S. government on conditional asset retirement obligations to Other noncurrent assets, a component of the consolidated balance sheets, $12.3 million and $10.7 million
as of November 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which was previously reported as Recoverable from the U.S. government and other third parties for environmental remediation costs and other. These reclassifications had no effect on
previously reported net income or net cash flows from operating activities. See Note 3(f).
The preparation of
the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Out of Period Adjustments
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts. The out of period adjustments relate to the Company
incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys fiscal 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. The out
of period adjustments resulted in the Company under reporting $0.6 million in net income in fiscal 2011. Management believes that such amount is not material to fiscal 2011 or previously reported financial statements.
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax
benefit and related balance sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance

on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments in fiscal 2010 combined with the effects of the fiscal 2011 adjustments

The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries. The
deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date of the change.
The carrying value of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future. The Company has established a valuation allowance against a
substantial portion of

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
its net deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits, given historical losses including accumulated other comprehensive losses. A valuation allowance is
required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including the Companys past and future performance, the market
environment in which it operates, the utilization of tax attributes in the past, the length of carryback and carryforward periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies.
Despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, the Company
believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. The
Companys tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The accounting standards provide guidance for the recognition and measurement in financial
statements for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax
position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. The technical merits of a tax position are derived from both statutory and judicial
authority (legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings, and case law) and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold,
the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the
financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. As the examination process progresses with tax authorities,
adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Tax reserve adjustments related to positions
impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Tests for impairment of goodwill are performed on an annual basis, or at any other time, if events
occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment as of September 1, 2011 and 2010, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
Under new accounting guidance adopted for fiscal 2011, the Company evaluates qualitative factors (including macroeconomic
conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, and overall financial

performance) to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill test. This step is referred to as the Step 0 analysis. If it is determined that it
is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill
impairment test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of
events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of the Companys recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1,
2011, the Company evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying
amount. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Companys Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, the Company primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and
estimates about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year
financial forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the
rates of return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of the Companys estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, the
Company evaluated the results of the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. The Company also ensured that the reporting unit
fair value was reasonable given the market value of the entire Company as of the valuation date.
There can be
no assurance that the Companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect, the Company may
be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity will need to proceed to the first step (Step One) of the two-step goodwill
impairment test. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, relevant events and circumstances as discussed above shall be assessed. If, after assessing the totality of
events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the impairment test are unnecessary.
Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the
business climate or legal factors; adverse cash flow trends; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; decline in stock price; and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset
group within a reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded.
All of the Companys recorded goodwill resides in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. As of September 1,
2011, the Company evaluated goodwill using a Step 0 analysis and determined that it was more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50% impairment) that the fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit exceeded its carrying
amount. As of September 1, 2010, to determine the fair value of the Companys Aerospace and Defense reporting unit under Step One, the Company primarily relied upon a discounted cash flow analysis which required significant assumptions and
estimates about future operations, including judgments about expected revenue growth and operating margins, and timing and amounts of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis were based on ten-year
financial forecasts developed internally by management. The analysis also involved discounting the future cash flows to a present value using a discount rate that properly accounted for the risk and nature of the reporting unit cash flows and the
rates of return debt and equity holders would require to invest their capital in the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit. In assessing the reasonableness of the Companys estimated fair value of the Aerospace and Defense reporting unit, the
Company evaluated the results of the discounted cash flow analysis in light of what investors are paying for similar interests in comparable aerospace and defense companies as of the valuation date. The Company also ensured that the reporting unit
fair value was reasonable given the market value of the entire Company as of the valuation date.
There can be
no assurance that the Companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Companys assumptions and estimates are incorrect, the Company may
be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods.

The Company expenses, on a current basis, recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and contamination
in ongoing operations. The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental contamination when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In most cases only a range
of reasonably probable costs can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimated amount is used when determinable, and the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. The
Companys environmental reserves include the costs of completing remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial and corrective actions,

regulatory oversight costs, the cost of operation and maintenance of the remedial action plan, and employee compensation costs for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of
time to remediation efforts. Calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual environmental site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted
laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Such estimates are based on the expected costs of investigation and remediation and the likelihood that other potentially responsible parties will be able to fulfill
their commitments at sites where the Company may be jointly or severally liable. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, the Company records an asset for estimated future recoveries that are estimable and probable. Some

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/m. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations","m. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
Conditional asset retirement obligations (CAROs) are legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and the related asset retirement costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related assets by the same amount as the liability. Asset
retirement costs are subsequently depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company records period-to-period changes in the CARO liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to
either the timing or the amount of the estimate of the undiscounted cash flows.
The Companys estimate of
CAROs associated with owned properties relates to estimated costs necessary for the legally required removal or remediation of various regulated materials, primarily asbestos disposal and radiological decontamination of an ordnance manufacturing
facility. For CAROs that are not expected to be retired in the next fifteen (15) years, the Company estimated the retirement date of such asset retirement obligations to be thirty (30) years from the date of adoption of the applicable
accounting standard on November 30, 2006. For leased properties, such obligations relate to the estimated cost of contractually required property restoration.

The Company considers the nature of the individual underlying contract and the type of products and services provided in
determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. Each method is applied consistently to all contracts having similar characteristics, as described below. The Company typically accounts for these contracts using the
percentage-of-completion method, and progress is measured on a cost-to-cost or units-of-delivery basis. Sales are recognized using various measures of progress depending on the contractual terms and scope of work of the contract. The Company
recognizes revenue on a units-of-delivery basis when contracts require unit deliveries on a frequent and routine basis. Sales using this measure of progress are recognized at the contractually agreed upon unit price. Where the scope of work on
contracts principally relates to research and/or development efforts, or the contract is predominantly a development effort with few deliverable

units, the Company recognizes revenue on a cost-to-cost basis. In this case, sales are recognized as costs are incurred and include estimated earned fees or profits calculated on the basis of the
relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Revenue on service or time and material contracts is recognized when performed. If at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract, the loss is recognized
immediately.
Certain government contracts contain cost or performance incentive provisions that provide for
increased or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. Incentive and award fees, which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, are included in estimated contract revenue
at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and anticipated performance. The Company continually evaluates its performance and incorporates any anticipated changes in penalties and
cost incentives into its revenue and earnings calculations. Performance incentives, which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event, generally are not recognized until an event occurs.
Revenue from real estate asset sales is recognized when a sufficient down-payment has been received, financing has been
arranged and title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. The allocation to cost of sales on real estate asset sales is based on a relative fair market value computation of the land sold which includes the
basis on the Companys book value, capitalized entitlement costs, and an estimate of the Companys continuing financial commitment.
Revenue that is not derived from long-term development and production contracts, or real estate asset transactions, is recognized when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists, delivery has
occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and payment from the customer is reasonably assured. Sales are recorded net of provisions for customer pricing allowances.

combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; or a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of
significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If
the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, then the Company would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded a $1.6 million
impairment charge associated with the write-down of a long-lived asset.
A long-lived asset classified as
held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In the period that the held for sale criteria are met, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for any initial

Dependence on Single Source and Other Third Party Suppliers
The Company uses a significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government
regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, the Company is often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often
discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. The Company is often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. To date the Company has been successful in establishing replacement materials
and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium
perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry with actual pricing based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the
Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to
require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
The Company is also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw
materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. The Company continues to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products
have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, the Company may not be able to continue to negotiate with its customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The
DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While
availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to the Companys programs.
Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of the Companys key raw materials, difficulty qualifying new sources of
supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, and/or a continuing volatility in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash

Dependence on Single Source and Other Third Party Suppliers
The Company uses a significant quantity of raw materials that are highly dependent on market fluctuations and government
regulations. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, the Company is often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often
discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. The Company is often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. To date the Company has been successful in establishing replacement materials
and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs.
The supply of ammonium
perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry with actual pricing based on the total industry demand. The slowdown and final close out of the
Space Shuttle Program has reduced the total national demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. Pricing appears to be stabilizing with recent decisions from NASA to continue Space Launch System Heavy Lift Vehicle program and the DoD to
require the use of domestic ammonium perchlorate. Primarily, price risk was foreseen and appropriate contract language is in place to compensate for market volatility for this product.
The Company is also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw
materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts. The Company continues to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The schedules and pricing of titanium mill products
have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, the Company may not be able to continue to negotiate with its customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The
DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the Berry Amendment (DFARS 225-7002, 252.225-7014) which imposes a requirement to procure certain strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While
availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote price in effect at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to the Companys programs.
Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of the Companys key raw materials, difficulty qualifying new sources of
supply, implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply, and/or a continuing volatility in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard which requires additional disclosures for plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The required
disclosures include a description of the Companys investment policies and strategies, the fair value of each major category of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair
value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets, and the significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of December 1, 2009, the
Company adopted the accounting standard that provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in
the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Upon adoption, the Company retrospectively adjusted its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial
data) to conform to the new standard. The adoption of the new standard did not change previously reported earnings per share amounts.
As of December 1, 2009, the Company adopted the accounting standard related to convertible debt securities that, upon conversion, may be settled by the issuer, fully or partially, in cash (See
Note 5).
As of December 1, 2010, the Company adopted the new accounting standards related to the use
of the milestone method of revenue recognition that applies to research or development transactions in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving uncertain future events or circumstances. The adoption of the new standards did not have
a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
As of
September 1, 2011, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. Previous guidance required that an entity test for goodwill impairment by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. Under this new amendment an entity is not
required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/y. New Accounting Pronouncements","y. New Accounting Pronouncements
In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This update
requires entities to (i) disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and (ii) present separately (i.e., on a gross basis
rather than as one net number), information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of changes in Level 3 fair value measurements. The update requires fair value disclosures by class of assets and liabilities rather
than by major category or line item in the statement of financial position. Disclosures regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
in both Level 2 and Level 3 are also required. For all portions of the update except the gross presentation of activity in the Level 3 roll forward, this standard was effective for the Company on March 1, 2010. For the gross presentation of
activity in the Level 3 roll forward, the new disclosures will be presented in the Companys quarterly financial statements for the period ending

February 29, 2012. As the accounting standard only impacts disclosures, the new standard will not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.
In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on disclosure of supplementary pro forma
information for business combinations. The new guidance requires that pro forma financial information should be prepared as if the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual period. The guidance is effective for the
Company for business combinations with acquisition dates occurring in and from the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
In May 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures. The new guidance
clarified the concepts applicable for fair value measurement and requires new disclosures, with a particular focus on Level 3 measurements. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be
applied retrospectively. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance.
In June 2011, the FASB issued amended guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. The amended guidance
eliminates one of the presentation options provided by current U.S. GAAP, that is to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In addition, it gives an entity the option to
present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is
effective for the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012, and will be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

The income tax provision of $6.1 million in fiscal 2011 is primarily related to
current federal tax expense of (i) $1.5 million for alternative minimum tax (AMT) offset by $1.5 million of deferred tax benefit; (ii) $0.2 million of current federal tax on earnings sheltered by net operating losses generated
from equity based compensation, the benefit of which was recorded directly to equity; (iii) $0.3 million true-up of interest accrual on the pending federal refund claims filed in 2010; (iv) current state taxes of $4.2 million; and
(v) deferred taxes of $1.4 million, which represents the excess of deferred tax expense from goodwill amortization over deferred tax benefit from research credits.
The income tax benefit of $3.9 million in fiscal 2010 is primarily related to the Company obtaining a Private Letter
Ruling (PLR) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowing the Company to revoke its election made on the fiscal 2003 income tax return to capitalize and amortize certain research expenditures. The revocation is effective
as of the fiscal 2007 income tax return, allowing a deduction on an amended fiscal 2007 tax return of the remaining unamortized balance. As a result of the PLR, an income tax benefit of $6.3 million was

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
recorded. This is offset by federal AMT expense of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $3.1 million. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.9 million
relating to prior years offset by $0.1 million of deferred tax expense recorded for fiscal 2010.
The
income tax benefit of $17.6 million in fiscal 2009 is primarily related to new guidance that was published by the Chief Counsels Office of the IRS in December 2008 clarifying which costs qualify for ten-year carryback of tax net operating
losses for refund of prior years taxes. As a result of the clarifying language, the Company recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 an income tax benefit of $19.7 million, of which $14.5 million was for the release of the
valuation allowance associated with the utilization of the qualifying tax net operating losses and $5.2 million was for the recognition of affirmative claims related to previous uncertain tax positions associated with prior years refund
claims related to the qualifying costs.
A valuation allowance has been recorded to offset a substantial
portion of the net deferred tax assets at November 30, 2011 and 2010 to reflect the uncertainty of realization. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized.
A review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered, including past and future performance, the market environment in which the Company operates, utilization of tax attributes in the past, length of carryback and carryforward
periods, and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. The Company determines cumulative losses on a
rolling twelve-quarter basis and the analysis includes the retirement benefit plan losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on all of its net deferred tax assets except for
the indefinite lived deferred tax assets relating to federal AMT credits and California research credits.
The
Company is routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While it is difficult to predict the outcome or timing of a particular tax matter, the Company believes it has adequately provided reserves for any reasonable foreseeable outcome
related to these matters.

The Company also
has a U.S. federal research credit carryforward of $9.9 million which begins expiring in fiscal 2021, and a California research credit carryforward of $0.7 million which has an indefinite carryforward period. Additionally, the Company
has a foreign tax credit carryforward of $2.6 million which begins expiring in fiscal 2012, if not utilized. These tax carryforwards are subject to examination by the tax authorities.

Senior Credit Facility
On November 18, 2011, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Senior
Credit Facility) with the lenders identified therein, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Senior Credit Facility replaces the prior credit facility and, among other things, (i) extends the maturity
date to November 18, 2016 (which date may be accelerated in certain cases); and (ii) replaces the existing revolving credit facility and credit-linked facility with (x) a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
up to $150.0 million (with a $100.0 million subfacility for standby letters of credit and a $5.0 million subfacility for swingline loans) and (y) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million. The term loan
facility will amortize at a rate of 5.0% of the original principal

amount per annum to be paid in equal quarterly installments with any remaining amounts due on the maturity date. Outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility may be voluntarily
prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, in general without premium or penalty.
As of November 30, 2011,
the Company had $67.1 million outstanding letters of credit under the $150.0 million revolving credit subfacility and had $50.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility.
In general, borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR plus 350 basis points
(subject to downward adjustment), or the base rate as it is defined in the credit agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, the Company is charged a commitment fee of 50 basis points per annum on unused amounts of the revolving
credit facility and 350 basis points per annum (subject to downward adjustment), along with a fronting fee of 25 basis points per annum, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit.
The Company guarantees the payment obligations under the Senior Credit Facility. Any borrowings are further secured by
(i) all equity interests owned or held by the loan parties, including interests in the Companys Easton subsidiary and 66% of the voting stock (and 100% of the non-voting stock) of all present and future first-tier foreign subsidiaries of
the loan parties; (ii) substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property and assets of the loan parties; and (iii) certain real property owned by the loan parties located in Orange, Virginia and Redmond, Washington. The
Companys real property located in California, including the real estate holdings of Easton, are excluded from collateralization under the Senior Credit Facility.
The Company is subject to certain limitations including the ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments and
acquisitions, and make certain restricted payments, including stock repurchases and dividends. The Senior Credit Facility includes events of default usual and customary for facilities of this nature, the occurrence of which could lead to an
acceleration of our obligations thereunder. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facility includes certain financial covenants, including that the Borrower maintain (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (subject to upward adjustment in
certain cases), calculated net of cash up to a maximum of $100.0; and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.40 to 1.00.

Pension Benefits
On November 25, 2008, the Company decided to amend the defined benefit pension and benefits restoration plans to freeze future accruals under such plans. Effective February 1, 2009 and
July 31, 2009, future benefit

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
accruals for non-collective bargaining-unit employees and collective bargaining unit employees were discontinued, respectively. No employees lost their previously earned pension benefits.
As of the last measurement date at November 30, 2011, the total defined benefit pension plan assets,
total projected benefit obligations, and the unfunded pension obligation for the qualified pension plan were approximately $1,296.8 million, $1,550.4 million, and $236.4 million, respectively. The Pension Protection Act (the PPA)
requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the funded status of the plan as of specified measurement dates. The funded ratio as of November 30, 2010 under the PPA for the
Companys tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan was 96.2% which was above the 96.0% ratio required under the PPA. The required ratio to be met as of the November 30, 2011 measurement date is 100%. The final calculated PPA funded ratio
as of November 30, 2011 is expected to be completed in the second half of 2012.
In general, the PPA
requires companies with underfunded plans to make up the shortfall over a seven year period. These values are based on assumptions specified by the IRS, and are typically not the same as the amounts used for corporate financial reporting. On
June 25, 2010, the president signed the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 (Pension Relief Act) into law. The Pension Relief Act allows pension plan sponsors to extend the
shortfall amortization period from the seven years required under the PPA to either nine years (with interest-only payments for the first two years) or 15 years for shortfall amortization bases created during the years for which relief is
elected. This election could be made for any two plan years during the period 2008-2011. The Company elected the funding relief for plan year beginning 2010 and expects to elect the funding relief for plan year beginning 2011 using the 15-year
alternative amortization.
The value of the unfunded accrued benefits and amount of required contribution each
year are based on a number of factors, including plan investment experience and interest rate environment and, as such, can fluctuate significantly from year to year. Companies may prepay contributions and, under certain circumstances, use those
prepayment credits to satisfy the required funding of the pension plans annual required contribution thereby allowing the Company to defer cash payments into the pension plan. The Company has accumulated $59.5 million in such prepayment
credits as of November 30, 2011. For fiscal 2012, the Company is not expecting to make a cash contribution to the pension plan.
The funded status of the pension plan may be adversely affected by the investment experience of the plans assets, by any changes in U.S. law, and by changes in the statutory interest rates used
by tax-qualified pension plans in the U.S. to calculate funding requirements or other plan experience. Accordingly, if the performance of the Companys plan assets does not meet our assumptions, if there are changes to the IRS
regulations or other applicable law or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, the future contributions to the Companys underfunded pension plan could be significant in future periods.

Medical and Life Benefits
The Company provides medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees, with varied coverage by employee group. Generally, employees hired after January 1, 1997 are not
eligible for medical and life insurance benefits. The medical benefit plan provides for cost sharing between the Company and its retirees in the form of retiree contributions, deductibles, and coinsurance. Medical and life benefit obligations are
unfunded.

Defined Contribution 401(k) Benefits
The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan and participation in the plan is available to all employees.
Company contributions to the plan generally have been based on a percentage of employee contributions and, prior to April 15, 2009, the Companys contributions to the plan had been directed entirely in the GenCorp Stock Fund. Effective
January 15, 2009, the Company discontinued the employer matching component

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
to the defined contribution 401(k) plan for non-collective bargaining-unit employees. Effective March 15, 2009, transfers into the GenCorp Stock Fund were no longer permitted. Effective
April 15, 2009, all future contribution investment elections directed into the GenCorp Stock Fund were redirected to other investment options and the Companys collective bargaining-unit employee matching contributions are being made in
cash. Effective the first full payroll commencing in July 2010, for non-collective bargaining-unit employees, the Company reinstated in cash its matching contributions at the same level in effect prior to January 15, 2009 and invested according
to participants investment elections in effect at the time of contribution. The Companys contributions to the 401(k) plan were $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, $3.7 million in fiscal 2010, and $2.0 million in fiscal 2009.

Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect assets and liabilities of the
pension plans. Pension accounting permits market gains and losses to be deferred and recognized over a period of years. This smoothing results in the creation of other accumulated income or loss which will be amortized to pension costs
in future years. The accounting method the Company utilizes recognizes one-fifth of the unamortized gains and losses in the market-related value of pension assets and all other gains and losses including changes in the discount rate used to
calculate benefit costs each year. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the market-related value of assets which smoothes asset values over three years. Although the
smoothing period mitigates some volatility in the calculation of annual retirement benefit expense, future expenses are impacted by changes in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in interest rates.

Certain actuarial assumptions, such as assumed discount rate, long-term rate of return, and assumed healthcare cost trend rates can have a significant effect on amounts reported for periodic cost of
pension benefits and medical and life benefits, as well as respective benefit obligation amounts. The assumed discount rate represents the market rate available for investments in high-quality fixed income instruments with maturities matched to the
expected benefit payments for pension and medical and life benefit plans.
The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets represents the rate of earnings expected in the funds invested, and funds to be invested, to provide for anticipated benefit payments to plan participants. The Company evaluated the plans historical investment
performance, its current and expected asset allocation, and, with input from the Companys external advisors and investment managers, developed best estimates of future investment performance of the plans assets. Based on this
analysis, the Company has assumed a long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.00%.
The Company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the medical benefit plans. For fiscal 2011 medical benefit obligations, the Company assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase for pre and
post 65 participants in the per capita cost of covered healthcare claims with the rate decreasing over nine years until reaching 5.0%.
A one percentage point change in the key assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations as of November 30, 2011 and on expense for fiscal 2011:

The Companys investment policy is to maximize the total rate of return with a view toward
long-term funding objectives of the plan to ensure that funds are available to meet benefit obligations when due. The plan assets are diversified to the extent necessary to minimize risk and to achieve an optimal balance between risk and
return. The Companys investment strategy focuses on higher return seeking investments in actively managed investment vehicles with an emphasis toward alternative investment strategies and allows for diversification as to the type of
assets, investment strategies employed, and number of investment managers used to carry out this strategy. These strategies are achieved using diversified asset types, which may include cash, equities, fixed income, real estate, private equity
holdings and derivatives. Allocations between these asset types may change as a result of changing market conditions and tactical investment opportunities.

The following is a description of the significant investment strategies and valuation
methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such investments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are
held in money market accounts or invested in Short-Term Investment Funds (STIFs). Cash and cash equivalents held in money market accounts are classified as Level 1 investments. STIFs are not traded on an exchange and active market,
and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments.

Equity securities
Equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and
through a range of market capitalization in common stocks and Common Collective Trusts (CCTs). Common stocks are stated at fair value as quoted on a recognized securities exchange and are valued at the last reported sales price on the
last business day of the fiscal year and are classified as Level 1 investments. CCTs are not traded on an exchange and active market, however, the fair value is determined based on the underlying investments as traded in an exchange and active
market, and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments. Derivatives primarily include options and short equity positions, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Derivatives include
call and put options, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Investments sold short are short equity positions which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1
investments.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)

Fixed income securities
Fixed income securities are invested in a variety of instruments including but not limited to government securities,
corporate debt securities, and asset-backed securities.
U.S. government securities are valued at bid
evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 2 investments. Foreign government securities are priced by investment managers using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data,
proprietary models, or indicative quotes and are classified as Level 3 investments.
Corporate debt
securities are invested in corporate bonds and CCTs. Corporate bonds that are actively traded in a robust and visible market are classified as Level 1 investments. Corporate bonds that are valued at bid evaluations using observable and
market-based inputs are classified as Level 2 investments. CCTs are priced by investment managers using observable inputs of the underlying bond securities and are classified as Level 2 investments.
Asset-backed securities, including government-backed mortgage securities, non-government-backed collateralized mortgage
obligations, asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, are valued at bid evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable or unobservable inputs. These securities are classified as Level 2 investments if the
evaluated prices are calculated using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 3 investments if the evaluated prices are calculated using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data, proprietary models, or indicative
quotes.
Investments sold short are short fixed income positions which are classified as Level 1 investments if
they are listed on an exchange and active market, and are classified as Level 2 investments if they are valued at bid evaluation using observable and market-based inputs.

Forward exchange contracts
Forward exchange contracts are not exchange-traded but are priced based on observable input. They are classified as Level
2 investments.

Real estate investments
Real estate investments are interests in real property holdings where the underlying properties are valued by independent
appraisers employing valuation techniques such as capitalization of future rental income and/or sales of comparable properties. If applicable, the properties may also be valued based on current indicative interest received by the Company from
third parties. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Private equity holdings
Private equity holdings are primarily limited partnerships and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in
U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Private equity holdings are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV), which are estimated by investment managers using inputs in which little or no
public market data exists. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

Alternative
investments
Alternative investments consist of hedge funds that employ a variety of investment
strategies. These funds invest across a range of equity and debt securities in a variety of industry sectors. Alternative investments are valued at NAV calculated by investment managers using a variety of valuation techniques for the underlying
investments. Since many of these valuations are based on unobservable inputs, they are classified as Level 3 investments.

The following is a description of the significant investment strategies and valuation
methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such investments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.

"
"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy/Cash and cash equivalents","Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are
held in money market accounts or invested in Short-Term Investment Funds (STIFs). Cash and cash equivalents held in money market accounts are classified as Level 1 investments. STIFs are not traded on an exchange and active market,
and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments.

"
"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy/Equity securities","Equity securities
Equity securities are invested broadly in U.S. and non-U.S. companies which are in various industries and
through a range of market capitalization in common stocks and Common Collective Trusts (CCTs). Common stocks are stated at fair value as quoted on a recognized securities exchange and are valued at the last reported sales price on the
last business day of the fiscal year and are classified as Level 1 investments. CCTs are not traded on an exchange and active market, however, the fair value is determined based on the underlying investments as traded in an exchange and active
market, and therefore are classified as Level 2 investments. Derivatives primarily include options and short equity positions, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Derivatives include
call and put options, which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1 investments. Investments sold short are short equity positions which are all listed on an exchange and active market and classified as Level 1
investments.

"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy/Fixed income securities","Fixed income securities
Fixed income securities are invested in a variety of instruments including but not limited to government securities,
corporate debt securities, and asset-backed securities.
U.S. government securities are valued at bid
evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 2 investments. Foreign government securities are priced by investment managers using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data,
proprietary models, or indicative quotes and are classified as Level 3 investments.
Corporate debt
securities are invested in corporate bonds and CCTs. Corporate bonds that are actively traded in a robust and visible market are classified as Level 1 investments. Corporate bonds that are valued at bid evaluations using observable and
market-based inputs are classified as Level 2 investments. CCTs are priced by investment managers using observable inputs of the underlying bond securities and are classified as Level 2 investments.
Asset-backed securities, including government-backed mortgage securities, non-government-backed collateralized mortgage
obligations, asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities, are valued at bid evaluations which are evaluated prices using observable or unobservable inputs. These securities are classified as Level 2 investments if the
evaluated prices are calculated using observable and market-based inputs and are classified as Level 3 investments if the evaluated prices are calculated using unobservable inputs such as extrapolated data, proprietary models, or indicative
quotes.
Investments sold short are short fixed income positions which are classified as Level 1 investments if
they are listed on an exchange and active market, and are classified as Level 2 investments if they are valued at bid evaluation using observable and market-based inputs.

"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy/Forward exchange contracts","Forward exchange contracts
Forward exchange contracts are not exchange-traded but are priced based on observable input. They are classified as Level
2 investments.

"
"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy/Real estate investments","Real estate investments
Real estate investments are interests in real property holdings where the underlying properties are valued by independent
appraisers employing valuation techniques such as capitalization of future rental income and/or sales of comparable properties. If applicable, the properties may also be valued based on current indicative interest received by the Company from
third parties. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

"
"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy/Private equity holdings","Private equity holdings
Private equity holdings are primarily limited partnerships and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in
U.S. and non-U.S. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies. Private equity holdings are valued at Net Asset Value (NAV), which are estimated by investment managers using inputs in which little or no
public market data exists. These investments are classified as Level 3 investments.

"
"/PART II/Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Interest Rate Risk/d. Plan Assets and Investment Policy/Alternative
investments","Alternative
investments
Alternative investments consist of hedge funds that employ a variety of investment
strategies. These funds invest across a range of equity and debt securities in a variety of industry sectors. Alternative investments are valued at NAV calculated by investment managers using a variety of valuation techniques for the underlying
investments. Since many of these valuations are based on unobservable inputs, they are classified as Level 3 investments.

The Company and its subsidiaries lease certain facilities, machinery and equipment, and office buildings under long-term,
non-cancelable operating leases. The leases generally provide for renewal options ranging from one to ten years and require the Company to pay for utilities, insurance, taxes, and maintenance. Rent expense was $12.9 million in fiscal 2011,
$11.3 million in fiscal 2010, and $11.6 million in fiscal 2009.
The Company also leases certain
surplus facilities to third parties. The Company recorded lease income of $6.7 million in fiscal 2011, $6.8 million in fiscal 2010, and $6.4 million in fiscal 2009 related to these arrangements, which have been included in net sales.
The future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings, including litigation in U.S. federal and state courts,
which arise out of, and are incidental to, the ordinary course of the Companys on-going and historical businesses. The Company is also subject from time to time to governmental investigations by federal and state agencies. The Company cannot
predict the outcome of such proceedings with any degree of certainty. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at managements best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency
amount is recorded. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than when the ultimate loss is known, and are refined each quarterly reporting period as additional information becomes available. For legal settlements where
there is no stated amount for interest, the Company will estimate an interest factor and discount the liability accordingly.
Summarized below are the outstanding matters the Company believes have more than a remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.

South El Monte Operable Unit (SEMOU) Related Cases
In October 2002, Aerojet and approximately 65 other individual and corporate defendants were served with four civil suits
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that sought recovery of costs allegedly incurred or to be incurred in response to the contamination present at the South El Monte Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley
Superfund site. The plaintiffs claims against Aerojet were based upon allegations of discharges from a former site in the El Monte area. Aerojet investigations did not identify a credible connection between the contaminants identified by the
plaintiff water entities in the SEMOU and those detected at Aerojets former facility located in El Monte, California, near the SEMOU (East Flair Drive site). The cases served on October 30, 2002 were denominated as follows:

San Gabriel Valley Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority v. Aerojet-General
Corporation, et al.

Southern California Water Company v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et al.

The City of Monterey Park v. Aerojet-General Corporation, et
al.
The contamination in the
SEMOU was also subject to a Unilateral Administrative Order (UAO) issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) naming Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to conduct the remedial design and
remedial action in the SEMOU.
These cases have been settled. Under the settlement, the water entities released
Aerojet and the Company from liability for all groundwater contamination in the geographic confines of the SEMOU alleged to have originated from the East Flair Drive site. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court approved and entered a

for good faith settlement conditioned upon the payment by Aerojet of its second settlement payment on or before December 5, 2011. The Company previously reserved for the settlement and there was no impact in fiscal 2011 to the Consolidated

County of Sacramento; Sacramento County Water Agency v. Aerojet-General Corporation and The Boeing Corporation [sic],  Civ. No. 2:09-at-1041. In the
complaint, the County and SCWA alleged that because groundwater contamination from various sources including Aerojet, McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing Corporation), and the former Mather Air Force Base, was continuing, the County and SCWA
should be awarded unspecified monetary damages as well as declaratory and equitable relief. Aerojet, Boeing, the County and SCWA reached a final settlement effective October 31, 2011 and Aerojets payment obligations under the settlement

c. Environmental Matters
The Company is involved in over forty environmental matters under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), and other federal, state, local, and foreign laws relating to soil and groundwater contamination, hazardous waste management activities, and other
environmental matters at some of its current and former facilities. The Company is also involved in a number of remedial activities at third party sites, not owned by the Company, where it is designated a potentially responsible party
(PRP) by either the U.S. EPA and/or a state agency. In many of these matters, the Company is involved with other PRPs. In many instances, the Companys liability and proportionate share of costs have not been determined largely due
to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of site conditions and the Companys involvement. While government agencies frequently claim PRPs are jointly and severally liable at such sites, in the Companys experience, interim and final
allocations of liability and costs are generally made based on relative contributions of waste or contamination. Anticipated costs associated with environmental remediation that are probable and estimable are accrued. In cases where a date to
complete remedial activities at a particular site cannot be determined by reference to agreements or otherwise, the Company projects costs over an appropriate time period not exceeding fifteen years; in such cases, generally the Company does not
have the ability to reasonably estimate environmental remediation costs that are beyond this period. Factors that could result in changes to the Companys estimates include completion of current and future soil and groundwater investigations,
new claims, future agency demands, discovery of more or less contamination than expected, discovery of new contaminants, modification of planned remedial actions, changes in estimated time required to remediate, new technologies, and changes in laws
and regulations.
As of November 30, 2011, the aggregate range of these anticipated environmental costs
was $190.6 million to $333.7 million and the accrued amount was $190.6 million. See Note 7(d) for a summary of the environmental reserve activity for fiscal 2011. Of these accrued liabilities, approximately 69% relates to the Sacramento, California
site and approximately 20% to the Baldwin Park Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley, California site. Each of those two sites is discussed below. The balance of the accrued liabilities relates to other sites for which the Companys
obligations are probable and estimable.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Sacramento, California Site","Sacramento, California Site
In 1989, a federal district court in California approved a Partial Consent Decree (PCD) requiring Aerojet,
among other things, to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to determine the nature and extent of impacts due to the release of chemicals from the Sacramento, California site, monitor the American River and
offsite public water supply wells, operate Groundwater Extraction and Treatment facilities (GETs) that collect groundwater at the site perimeter, and pay certain government oversight costs. The primary chemicals of concern for both
on-site and off-site groundwater are trichloroethylene (TCE), perchlorate, and n-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The PCD has been revised several times, most recently in 2002. The 2002 PCD revision (a) separated the
Sacramento site into multiple operable units to allow quicker implementation of remedy for critical areas; (b) required the Company to guarantee up to $75 million (in addition to a prior $20 million guarantee) to assure that Aerojets
Sacramento remediation activities are fully funded; and (c) removed approximately 2,600 acres of non-contaminated land from the U.S. EPA superfund designation.
Aerojet is involved in various stages of soil and groundwater investigation, remedy selection, design, and remedy
construction associated with the operable units. In 2002, the U.S. EPA issued a UAO requiring Aerojet to implement the U.S. EPA-approved remedial action in the Western Groundwater Operable Unit. An identical order was issued by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley (Central Valley RWQCB). On July 7, 2011, EPA issued Aerojet its Approval of Remedial Action Construction Completion Report for Western Groundwater Operable Unit and its
Determination of Remedy as Operational and Functional. On September 20, 2011 U.S. EPA issued two UAOs to Aerojet to complete a remedial design and implement remedial action for the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. One UAO addresses
groundwater and the other addresses soils within the Perimeter Groundwater Operable Unit. Issuance of the UAOs is the next step in the

enforcement. The appeal had been held in abeyance pending negotiations with the Los Angeles RWQCB, but due to a two-year limitation on the abeyance period, the appeal was dismissed without prejudice. In September 2001, Aerojet submitted a limited
work plan to the Los Angeles RWQCB.
On February 21, 2001, Aerojet received a General Notice Letter from
the U.S. EPA naming Aerojet as a PRP with regard to the SEMOU of the San Gabriel Valley Basin, California Superfund site. On April 1, 2002, Aerojet received a Special Notice Letter from the U.S. EPA that requested Aerojet enter into
negotiations with it regarding the performance of a remedial design and remedial action for the SEMOU. In light of this letter, Aerojet performed a limited site investigation of the East Flair Drive site. The data collected and summarized in the
report showed that chemicals including TCE and PCE were present in the soil and groundwater at, and near, the El Monte location. Site investigations are ongoing.
On August 29, 2003, the U.S. EPA issued a UAO against Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to
conduct the remedial design and remedial action in the SEMOU. The cost to implement projects under the UAO prepared by the U.S. EPA and the water entities was estimated to be approximately $90 million. Aerojet participated in mediation with EPA,
DTSC and the water entities to resolve the claims, and reached a settlement with EPA and DTSC and the water entities that had filed four separate lawsuits previously discussed under Legal Matters. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court
approved and entered a partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which incorporated settlements with the water entities and resolved Aerojets liability under the
UAO.
On November 17, 2005, Aerojet notified the Los Angeles RWQCB and the U.S. EPA that Aerojet was
involved in research and development at the East Flair Drive site that included the use of 1,4-dioxane. Aerojets investigation of that issue is continuing. Oversight of the East Flair Drive site was transferred from the RWQCB to the DTSC in

As part of Aerojets sale of its Electronics and Information Systems (EIS) business to Northrop in
October 2001, the U.S. EPA approved a Prospective Purchaser Agreement with Northrop to absolve it of pre-closing liability for contamination caused by the Azusa, California operations, which liability remains with Aerojet. As part of that agreement,
the Company agreed to provide a $25 million guarantee of Aerojets obligations under the Project Agreement.
As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of anticipated costs through the term of the agreement for the BPOU site
was $38.6 million to $76.0 million and the accrued amount was $38.6 million included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. Expenditures associated with this matter are partially recoverable subject to the Global Settlement and
Northrop Agreement allocations. Recoverable estimates for this matter are included as a component of the Companys estimated recoverable amounts from the U.S. Government and Northrop.

South El Monte Operable Unit
Aerojet previously owned and operated manufacturing facilities located on East Flair Drive in El Monte, California. On
December 21, 2000, Aerojet received an order from the Los Angeles RWQCB requiring a work plan for investigation of this former site. On January 22, 2001, Aerojet filed an appeal of the order with the Los Angeles RWQCB asserting selective
enforcement. The appeal had been held in abeyance pending negotiations with the Los Angeles RWQCB, but due to a two-year limitation on the abeyance period, the appeal was dismissed without prejudice. In September 2001, Aerojet submitted a limited
work plan to the Los Angeles RWQCB.
On February 21, 2001, Aerojet received a General Notice Letter from
the U.S. EPA naming Aerojet as a PRP with regard to the SEMOU of the San Gabriel Valley Basin, California Superfund site. On April 1, 2002, Aerojet received a Special Notice Letter from the U.S. EPA that requested Aerojet enter into
negotiations with it regarding the performance of a remedial design and remedial action for the SEMOU. In light of this letter, Aerojet performed a limited site investigation of the East Flair Drive site. The data collected and summarized in the
report showed that chemicals including TCE and PCE were present in the soil and groundwater at, and near, the El Monte location. Site investigations are ongoing.
On August 29, 2003, the U.S. EPA issued a UAO against Aerojet and approximately 40 other parties requiring them to
conduct the remedial design and remedial action in the SEMOU. The cost to implement projects under the UAO prepared by the U.S. EPA and the water entities was estimated to be approximately $90 million. Aerojet participated in mediation with EPA,
DTSC and the water entities to resolve the claims, and reached a settlement with EPA and DTSC and the water entities that had filed four separate lawsuits previously discussed under Legal Matters. On August 19, 2011, the U.S. District Court
approved and entered a partial consent decree between Aerojet, EPA, and the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which incorporated settlements with the water entities and resolved Aerojets liability under the
UAO.
On November 17, 2005, Aerojet notified the Los Angeles RWQCB and the U.S. EPA that Aerojet was
involved in research and development at the East Flair Drive site that included the use of 1,4-dioxane. Aerojets investigation of that issue is continuing. Oversight of the East Flair Drive site was transferred from the RWQCB to the DTSC in
2007 and Aerojet has entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with DTSC. Site investigation activities are ongoing.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk/Toledo, Ohio Site","Toledo, Ohio Site
The Company previously manufactured products for the automotive industry at a Toledo, Ohio site, which was adjacent to the
Ottawa River. This facility was divested in 1990 and the Company indemnified the buyer for claims and liabilities arising out of certain pre-divestiture environmental matters. In August 2007, the Company, along with numerous other companies,
received from the United States Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service a notice of a Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment Plan for the Ottawa River and Northern Maumee Bay. A group of PRPs, including the Company, was formed
to respond to the NRD assessment and to pursue funding from the Great Lakes Legacy Act for primary restoration. The restoration project performed by the group consisted of river dredging and land-filling river sediments with a total project cost in
the range of approximately $47 to $49 million, one half of which was funded through the Great Lakes Legacy Act and the net project costs to the PRP group was estimated at $23.5 to $24.5 million. The dredging of the river that began in December 2009
has been completed. In February 2011, the parties reached an agreement on allocation. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated range of the Companys share of anticipated costs for the NRD matter was $2.1 million to $3.9 million and the
accrued amount was $2.1 million which is included as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable. Still unresolved at this time is the actual NRD Assessment itself. It is
not possible to predict the outcome, timing, or the financial impact of these types of assessments, which are typically long processes lasting several years.
In 2008, Textileather, the current owner of the former Toledo, Ohio site, filed a lawsuit against the Company claiming, among other things, that the Company failed to indemnify and defend Textileather for
certain contractual environmental obligations. A second suit related to past and future Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), closure costs was filed in late 2009. On May 5, 2010, the District Court granted the Companys
Motion for Summary Judgment, thereby dismissing the claims in the initial action. Textileather has appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeal. Briefs have been filed and oral argument is scheduled for March 2, 2012. There are no District
Court ordered dates in the second Textileather suit, but the parties are conducting informal discovery. As of November 30, 2011, the estimated anticipated costs and accrued amount for the Textileather matter was $2.1 million which is included
as a component of the Companys environmental reserves. None of the expenditures related to this matter are recoverable.

d. Environmental Reserves and Estimated Recoveries

Reserves
The Company reviews on a quarterly basis
estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. The Company has an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period,
except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increases, the reliability of such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative
work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs
can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as
the Company periodically evaluates and revises such estimates as new information becomes available. The Company cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for
estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors such as the regulatory approval process, the time required to design, construct, and implement the remedy.

The effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and the Companys
obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. The Company will continue its
efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.
As part of the acquisition of the Atlantic Research Corporation (ARC) propulsion business, Aerojet entered
into an agreement with ARC pursuant to which Aerojet is responsible for up to $20.0 million of costs (Pre-Close Environmental Costs) associated with environmental issues that arose prior to Aerojets acquisition of the ARC
propulsion business. Pursuant to a separate agreement with the U.S. government which was entered into prior to the completion of the ARC acquisition, these costs are recovered through the establishment of prices for Aerojets products and
services sold to the U.S. government. A summary of the Pre-Close Environmental Costs is shown below (in millions):

Estimated Recoveries
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and the former Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be
recovered. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental
expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs
associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to the Sacramento site and former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of
operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because the Company reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to the Companys contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government
contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of
the Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):

The Companys applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the
Northrop Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental
reserve until an arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While the Company is currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop
Agreement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

e. Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
As of November 30, 2011, arrangements with off-balance sheet risk consisted of:
 $67.1 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit expiring within the next twelve months,
the majority of which may be renewed, primarily to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
 Up to $120.0 million aggregate in guarantees by GenCorp of Aerojets obligations to U.S. government agencies for environmental remediation activities (See Note 7(b) for additional
information).
 Guarantees, jointly and severally, by the
Companys material domestic subsidiaries of its obligations under its Senior Credit Facility and its

/

% Notes.
In addition to the items discussed above, the Company will from time to time enter into certain types of contracts that
require us to indemnify parties against potential third-party and other claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary indemnification to purchasers of its businesses or
assets including, for example, claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination existing prior to disposition; (ii) certain real estate leases, under
which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for claims arising from the use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with officers and directors, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such
persons for liabilities arising out of their relationship with the Company. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated.
The Company also uses surety bonds to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
Additionally, the Company issues purchase orders and makes other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated
requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract is terminated.
8.
Redeemable Common Stock
The Company inadvertently failed to register with the SEC the issuance of certain of its common shares
in its defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan (the Plan). As a result, certain Plan participants who purchased such securities pursuant to the Plan may have the right to rescind certain of their purchases for consideration
equal to the purchase price paid for the securities (or if such security has been sold, to receive consideration with respect to any loss incurred on such sale) plus interest from the date of purchase. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the
Company has classified 0.4 and 0.5 million shares, respectively, as redeemable common stock because the redemption features are not within the control of the Company. The Company may also be subject to civil and other penalties by regulatory
authorities as a result of the failure to register these shares. These shares have always been treated as outstanding for financial reporting purposes. In June 2008, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register future
transactions in the GenCorp Stock Fund in the Plan. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $1.3 million, respectively, for realized losses and interest associated with this
matter.

Operating Segments and Related Disclosures
The Companys operations are organized into two operating segments based on different products and
customer bases: Aerospace and Defense, and Real Estate. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1).
The Company evaluates its operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment operations. Segment performance excludes corporate income and expenses, legacy
income or expenses, provisions for unusual items not related to the segment operations, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes.
Selected financial information for each reportable segment was as follows:

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet
accounts. The out of period adjustments primarily relate to the Company incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for
uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded an adjustment to correct the identified errors resulting in the Company under reporting income by approximately $1.0 million. See
Note 1(a).

During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax benefit and related balance
sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments resulted in the Company reporting $3.5 million and $0.7 million
in additional net income in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively. See Note 1(a).

In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. During fiscal 2009, Snappon SA had legal judgments rendered against it under French law, aggregating
2.9 million plus interest related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees of Snappon SA. Additionally, during fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the

Reserves
The Company reviews on a quarterly basis
estimated future remediation costs that could be incurred over the contractual term or next fifteen years of the expected remediation. The Company has an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period,
except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs increases, the reliability of such estimates decrease. These estimates consider the investigative
work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs
can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as
the Company periodically evaluates and revises such estimates as new information becomes available. The Company cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for
estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors such as the regulatory approval process, the time required to design, construct, and implement the remedy.

The effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and the Companys
obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. The Company will continue its
efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.
As part of the acquisition of the Atlantic Research Corporation (ARC) propulsion business, Aerojet entered
into an agreement with ARC pursuant to which Aerojet is responsible for up to $20.0 million of costs (Pre-Close Environmental Costs) associated with environmental issues that arose prior to Aerojets acquisition of the ARC
propulsion business. Pursuant to a separate agreement with the U.S. government which was entered into prior to the completion of the ARC acquisition, these costs are recovered through the establishment of prices for Aerojets products and
services sold to the U.S. government. A summary of the Pre-Close Environmental Costs is shown below (in millions):

Estimated Recoveries
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and the former Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be
recovered. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental
expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.

GENCORP INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (Continued)
Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs
associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to the Sacramento site and former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of
operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because the Company reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to the Companys contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government
contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of
the Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):
Total reimbursable costs under the Northrop Agreement


The Companys applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the
Northrop Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental
reserve until an arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While the Company is currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop
Agreement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs
can be estimated. In establishing the Companys reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as
the Company periodically evaluates and revises such estimates as new information becomes available. The Company cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for
estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors such as the regulatory approval process, the time required to design, construct, and implement the remedy.

The effect of the final resolution of environmental matters and the Companys
obligations for environmental remediation and compliance cannot be accurately predicted due to the uncertainty concerning both the amount and timing of future expenditures and due to regulatory or technological changes. The Company will continue its
efforts to mitigate past and future costs through pursuit of claims for recoveries from insurance coverage and other PRPs and continued investigation of new and more cost effective remediation alternatives and associated technologies.
As part of the acquisition of the Atlantic Research Corporation (ARC) propulsion business, Aerojet entered
into an agreement with ARC pursuant to which Aerojet is responsible for up to $20.0 million of costs (Pre-Close Environmental Costs) associated with environmental issues that arose prior to Aerojets acquisition of the ARC
propulsion business. Pursuant to a separate agreement with the U.S. government which was entered into prior to the completion of the ARC acquisition, these costs are recovered through the establishment of prices for Aerojets products and
services sold to the U.S. government. A summary of the Pre-Close Environmental Costs is shown below (in millions):

Estimated Recoveries
On January 12, 1999, Aerojet and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle
(Global Settlement) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an
appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and the former Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be
recovered. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet entered into an agreement with Northrop (the Northrop Agreement) whereby Aerojet is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental
expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to annual and cumulative limitations. The current annual billing limitation to Northrop is $6.0 million.

Pursuant to the Global Settlement covering environmental costs
associated with Aerojets Sacramento site and its former Azusa site, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of such costs related to the Sacramento site and former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of
operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because the Company reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations.
Allowable environmental costs are charged to the Companys contracts as the costs are incurred. Aerojets mix of
contracts can affect the actual reimbursement made by the U.S. government. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on
Aerojets sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business. Annually, the Company evaluates Aerojets forecasted business volume under U.S. government
contracts and programs and the relative size of Aerojets commercial business as part of its long-term business review.
Pursuant to the Northrop Agreement, environmental expenditures to be reimbursed are subject to annual limitations and the total reimbursements are limited to a ceiling of $189.7 million. A summary of
the Northrop Agreement activity is shown below (in millions):

The Companys applicable cost estimates reached the cumulative limitation under the
Northrop Agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Accordingly, subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company will incur a higher percentage of expense related to additions to the Sacramento site and BPOU site environmental
reserve until an arrangement is reached with the U.S. government. While the Company is currently seeking an arrangement with the U.S. government to recover environmental expenditures in excess of the reimbursement ceiling identified in the Northrop
Agreement, there can be no assurances that such a recovery will be obtained, or if not obtained, that such unreimbursed environmental expenditures will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

As of November 30, 2011, arrangements with off-balance sheet risk consisted of:
 $67.1 million in outstanding commercial letters of credit expiring within the next twelve months,
the majority of which may be renewed, primarily to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
 Up to $120.0 million aggregate in guarantees by GenCorp of Aerojets obligations to U.S. government agencies for environmental remediation activities (See Note 7(b) for additional
information).
 Guarantees, jointly and severally, by the
Companys material domestic subsidiaries of its obligations under its Senior Credit Facility and its

/

% Notes.
In addition to the items discussed above, the Company will from time to time enter into certain types of contracts that
require us to indemnify parties against potential third-party and other claims. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) divestiture agreements, under which the Company may provide customary indemnification to purchasers of its businesses or
assets including, for example, claims arising from the operation of the businesses prior to disposition, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination existing prior to disposition; (ii) certain real estate leases, under
which the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for claims arising from the use of the applicable premises; and (iii) certain agreements with officers and directors, under which the Company may be required to indemnify such
persons for liabilities arising out of their relationship with the Company. The terms of such obligations vary. Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated.
The Company also uses surety bonds to collateralize obligations for environmental remediation and insurance coverage.
Additionally, the Company issues purchase orders and makes other commitments to suppliers for equipment, materials, and supplies in the normal course of business. These purchase commitments are generally for volumes consistent with anticipated
requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers and would be subject to reimbursement if a cost-plus contract is terminated.
8.
Redeemable Common Stock
The Company inadvertently failed to register with the SEC the issuance of certain of its common shares
in its defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan (the Plan). As a result, certain Plan participants who purchased such securities pursuant to the Plan may have the right to rescind certain of their purchases for consideration
equal to the purchase price paid for the securities (or if such security has been sold, to receive consideration with respect to any loss incurred on such sale) plus interest from the date of purchase. As of November 30, 2011 and 2010, the
Company has classified 0.4 and 0.5 million shares, respectively, as redeemable common stock because the redemption features are not within the control of the Company. The Company may also be subject to civil and other penalties by regulatory
authorities as a result of the failure to register these shares. These shares have always been treated as outstanding for financial reporting purposes. In June 2008, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register future
transactions in the GenCorp Stock Fund in the Plan. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $1.3 million, respectively, for realized losses and interest associated with this
matter.

Operating Segments and Related Disclosures
The Companys operations are organized into two operating segments based on different products and
customer bases: Aerospace and Defense, and Real Estate. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1).
The Company evaluates its operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment operations. Segment performance excludes corporate income and expenses, legacy
income or expenses, provisions for unusual items not related to the segment operations, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet
accounts. The out of period adjustments primarily relate to the Company incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for
uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded an adjustment to correct the identified errors resulting in the Company under reporting income by approximately $1.0 million. See
Note 1(a).
(2)
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax benefit and related balance
sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments resulted in the Company reporting $3.5 million and $0.7 million
in additional net income in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively. See Note 1(a).

Discontinued Operations
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. During fiscal 2009, Snappon SA had legal judgments rendered against it under French law, aggregating
2.9 million plus interest related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees of Snappon SA. Additionally, during fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the
Paris Commercial Court (See Note 7(b)).

(i) in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of any guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of the capital stock of any guarantor and
(ii) in the event that the Company attains investment grade status. The subsidiary guarantees are senior subordinated obligations of each subsidiary

guarantor and rank (i) junior in right of payment with all senior indebtedness, (ii) equal in right of payment with all senior subordinated indebtedness, and (iii) senior in right
of payment to all subordinated indebtedness, in each case, of that subsidiary guarantor. The subsidiary guarantees will also be effectively subordinated to any collateralized indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantor with respect to the assets
collateralizing that indebtedness. Absent both default and notice as specified in the Companys Senior Credit Facility and agreements governing the Companys outstanding convertible notes and the 9

2
% Notes, there are no restrictions on the Companys
ability to obtain funds from its 100% owned subsidiary guarantors by dividend or loan.
The Company has
not presented separate financial and narrative information for each of the subsidiary guarantors, because it believes that such financial and narrative information would not provide investors with any additional information that would be material in
evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees. Therefore, the following condensed consolidating financial information summarizes the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the Companys guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

Operating Segments and Related Disclosures
The Companys operations are organized into two operating segments based on different products and
customer bases: Aerospace and Defense, and Real Estate. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1).
The Company evaluates its operating segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment
performance. Segment performance represents net sales from continuing operations less applicable costs, expenses and provisions for unusual items relating to the segment operations. Segment performance excludes corporate income and expenses, legacy
income or expenses, provisions for unusual items not related to the segment operations, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes.
Selected financial information for each reportable segment was as follows:

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet
accounts. The out of period adjustments primarily relate to the Company incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for
uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded an adjustment to correct the identified errors resulting in the Company under reporting income by approximately $1.0 million. See
Note 1(a).
(2)
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax benefit and related balance
sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments resulted in the Company reporting $3.5 million and $0.7 million
in additional net income in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively. See Note 1(a).

Discontinued Operations
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. During fiscal 2009, Snappon SA had legal judgments rendered against it under French law, aggregating
2.9 million plus interest related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees of Snappon SA. Additionally, during fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the
Paris Commercial Court (See Note 7(b)).

guarantor and rank (i) junior in right of payment with all senior indebtedness, (ii) equal in right of payment with all senior subordinated indebtedness, and (iii) senior in right
of payment to all subordinated indebtedness, in each case, of that subsidiary guarantor. The subsidiary guarantees will also be effectively subordinated to any collateralized indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantor with respect to the assets
collateralizing that indebtedness. Absent both default and notice as specified in the Companys Senior Credit Facility and agreements governing the Companys outstanding convertible notes and the 9

% Notes, there are no restrictions on the Companys
ability to obtain funds from its 100% owned subsidiary guarantors by dividend or loan.
The Company has
not presented separate financial and narrative information for each of the subsidiary guarantors, because it believes that such financial and narrative information would not provide investors with any additional information that would be material in
evaluating the sufficiency of the guarantees. Therefore, the following condensed consolidating financial information summarizes the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the Companys guarantor and non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax provision and related balance sheet
accounts. The out of period adjustments primarily relate to the Company incorrectly calculating the tax benefit on a tax refund associated with an election made on the Companys 2003 income tax return and the Company not recording a reserve for
uncertain tax positions during the appropriate period. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded an adjustment to correct the identified errors resulting in the Company under reporting income by approximately $1.0 million. See
Note 1(a).
(2)
During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, the Company recorded out of period adjustments to the income tax benefit and related balance
sheet accounts. The Company incorrectly recorded a valuation allowance on its U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credits and California research credits. The out of period adjustments resulted in the Company reporting $3.5 million and $0.7 million
in additional net income in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively. See Note 1(a).

Discontinued Operations
In November 2003, the Company announced the closing of a GDX manufacturing facility in Chartres, France
owned by Snappon SA, a subsidiary of the Company. The decision resulted primarily from declining sales volumes with French automobile manufacturers. During fiscal 2009, Snappon SA had legal judgments rendered against it under French law, aggregating
2.9 million plus interest related to wrongful discharge claims by certain former employees of Snappon SA. Additionally, during fiscal 2009, Snappon SA filed for declaration of suspensions of payments with the clerks office of the
Paris Commercial Court (See Note 7(b)).

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of November 30, 2011, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of November 30, 2011 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the Company;

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
With
the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal
Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
November 30, 2011.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
November 30, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears in Item 8.

Changes In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

As of November 30, 2011, there are no more shares available to be issued under any type of incentive award under the GenCorp Inc. 1999 Equity
and Performance Incentive Plan. The maximum number of shares available for issuance to participants under the GenCorp Inc. 2009 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan is 2,000,000 shares, all of which may be awarded as incentive stock options.
Subject to the total shares available to be issued under the plan, the following specific limits apply: (A) no more than 200,000 shares may be issued to nonemployee directors and no nonemployee director may receive more than
150,000 shares in any
(2)
The number of securities in Column (c) is net of the maximum 267,032 shares that may be issued pursuant to additional stock options and
restricted stock awards that will be granted in 2012, 2013 and 2014 if the Company attains performance goals specified in equity awards made during 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

The Company also maintains the GenCorp Inc. and Participating Subsidiaries Deferred Bonus Plan. This plan allows participating employees to defer a
portion of their compensation for future distribution. All or a portion of such deferrals made prior to November 30, 2009 could be allocated to an account based on the Companys common stock and does permit limited distributions in the
form of Company common shares. However, distributions in the form of common shares are permitted only at the election of the Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and, according to the terms of the plan,
individuals serving as officers or directors of the Company are not permitted to receive distributions in the form of Company common shares until at least six months after such individual ceases to be an officer or director of the Company. The table
does not include information about this plan because no options, warrants or rights are available under this plan and no specific number of shares is set aside under this plan as available for future issuance. Based upon the price of Company common
shares on November 30, 2011, the maximum number of shares that could be distributed to employees not subject to the restrictions on officers and directors (if permitted by the Organization & Compensation Committee) would be 17,081.
This plan was amended effective November 30, 2009 to prevent the application of future deferrals to the Company common stock investment program.
