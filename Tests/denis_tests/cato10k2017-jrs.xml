fashion specialty stores at February 3, 2018, in 33 states, principally in the
southeastern United States, under the names &#8220;Cato,&#8221; &#8220;Cato Fashions,&#8221; &#8220;Cato
Plus,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s Fashion,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s Fashion Metro&#8221; and &#8220;Versona.&#8221;&#160; The Cato concept
seeks to offer quality fashion apparel and accessories at low prices, every day
in junior/missy and plus sizes. The Cato concept&#8217;s stores and e-commerce
website feature a broad assortment of apparel and accessories, including dressy,
career, and casual sportswear, dresses, coats, shoes, lingerie, costume jewelry
and handbags. A major portion of the Cato concept&#8217;s merchandise is sold under
its private label and is produced by various vendors in accordance with the
concept&#8217;s specifications.&#160; The It&#8217;s Fashion and It&#8217;s Fashion Metro concepts
offer fashion with a focus on the latest trendy styles for the entire family at
low prices every day.&#160; The Versona concept&#8217;s stores and e-commerce website
offer quality fashion apparel items, jewelry and accessories at exceptional
values every day.&#160; The Company&#8217;s stores range in size from 2,100 to 19,000
square feet and are located primarily in strip shopping centers anchored by
national discounters or market-dominant grocery stores.&#160; The Company emphasizes
friendly customer service and coordinated merchandise presentations in an
appealing store environment. The Company offers its own credit card and layaway
plan. Credit and layaway sales under the Company&#8217;s plan represented 7% of
retail sales in fiscal 2017. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, &#8220;Reportable Segment Information,&#8221; for a discussion of information
regarding the Company&#8217;s two reportable segments: retail and credit.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Business" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company&#8217;s
primary objective is to be the leading fashion specialty retailer for fashion
and value in its markets. Management believes the Company&#8217;s success is
dependent upon its ability to differentiate its stores from department stores,
mass merchandise discount stores and competing specialty stores. The key
elements of the Company&#8217;s business strategy are:
<company_defined_section title="Merchandise Assortment." parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">The Company&#8217;s
stores offer a wide assortment of on-trend apparel and accessory items in
primarily junior/missy, plus sizes, mens and kids sizes newborn to 7 with an
emphasis on color, product coordination and selection.&#160; Colors and styles are
coordinated and presented so that outfit selection is easily made.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Value Pricing." parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">The Company
offers quality merchandise that is generally priced below comparable
merchandise offered by department stores and mall specialty apparel chains, but
is generally more fashionable than merchandise offered by discount stores.
Management believes that the Company has positioned itself as the every day low
price leader in its market segment.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Strip   Shopping Center Locations." parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">The Company locates its stores
principally in convenient strip centers anchored by national discounters or
market-dominant grocery stores that attract large numbers of potential
customers.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Customer Service." parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">Store managers and sales associates are trained to provide prompt
and courteous
service and to assist customers in merchandise selection and wardrobe coordination.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Credit and Layaway Programs" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">.&#160; The Company offers its own credit card and a layaway
plan to make the purchase of its merchandise more convenient for its customers.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Merchandising" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;"></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Merchandising" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company seeks to
offer a broad selection of high quality and exceptional value apparel and
accessories to suit the various lifestyles of fashion and value-conscious
customers. In addition, the Company strives to offer on-trend fashion in
exciting colors with consistent fit and quality.
The
Company&#8217;s merchandise lines include dressy, career, and casual sportswear,
dresses, coats, shoes, lingerie, costume jewelry, handbags, men&#8217;s wear and
lines for kids and newborns. The Company primarily offers exclusive merchandise
with fashion and quality comparable to mall specialty stores at low prices,
every day.
The Company believes that the collaboration of its merchandising and design
teams with an expanded in-house product development and direct sourcing
function has enhanced merchandise offerings and delivers quality, exclusive
on-trend styles at lower prices. The product development and direct sourcing
operations provide research on emerging fashion and color trends, technical
services and direct sourcing options.
As a part
of its merchandising strategy, members of the Company&#8217;s merchandising and
design staff frequently attend trade shows to stay abreast of latest trends and
styles, visit selected stores to monitor the merchandise offerings of other
retailers, regularly communicate with store operations associates and
frequently confer with key vendors.&#160; The Company also takes aggressive
markdowns on slow-selling merchandise and typically does not carry over
merchandise to the next season.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Purchasing, Allocation and Distribution" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">Although
the Company purchases merchandise from approximately 439 suppliers, most of its
merchandise is purchased from approximately 100 primary vendors. In fiscal
2017, purchases from the Company&#8217;s largest vendor accounted for approximately
11% of the Company&#8217;s total purchases. The Company is not dependent on its
largest vendor or any other vendor for merchandise purchases, and the loss of
any single vendor or group of vendors would not have a material adverse effect
on the Company&#8217;s operating results or financial condition. A substantial
portion of the Company&#8217;s merchandise is sold under its private labels and is
produced by various vendors in accordance with the Company&#8217;s strict
specifications. The Company sources a majority of its merchandise directly from
manufacturers overseas. The Company purchases its remaining merchandise from
domestic importers and vendors, which typically minimizes the time necessary to
purchase and obtain shipments.&#160; The Company opened its own overseas sourcing operations
in the fall of 2014, replacing the Company&#8217;s former sourcing agent in 2015.
Although a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s merchandise is manufactured
overseas, the Company does not expect that any economic, political or social
unrest in any one country would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s
ability to obtain adequate supplies of merchandise.&#160; However, the Company can
give no assurance that any changes or disruptions in its merchandise supply
chain would not materially and adversely affect the Company.&#160; See &#8220;Risk Factors
&#8211; Risks Relating To Our Business &#8211; Because we source a significant portion of
our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks
associated with international operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or
other problems affecting the Company&#8217;s merchandise supply chain could
materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations
and financial condition.&#8221;
An important component of the Company&#8217;s strategy is the allocation of
merchandise to individual stores based on an analysis of sales trends by
merchandise category, customer profiles and climatic conditions. A merchandise
control system provides current information on the sales activity of each
merchandise style in each of the Company&#8217;s stores. Point-of-sale terminals in
the stores collect and transmit sales and inventory information to the
Company&#8217;s central database, permitting timely response to sales trends on a
store-by-store basis.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Advertising" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company uses television, in-store signage, graphics, a Company website, an
e-commerce website and social media as its primary advertising media.&#160; The
Company&#8217;s total advertising expenditures were approximately 0.7%, 0.8% and 0.8%
of retail sales for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
<company_defined_section title="Store Operations" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company&#8217;s store operations management team consists of one director of
stores, five territorial managers, 16 regional managers and 136 district
managers. Regional managers receive a salary plus a bonus based on achieving
targeted goals for sales, payroll and shrinkage control. District managers
receive a salary plus a bonus based on achieving targeted objectives for
district sales increases and shrinkage control. Stores are typically staffed
with a manager, two assistant managers and additional part-time sales
associates depending on the size of the store and seasonal personnel needs.
Store managers receive a salary and all other store personnel are paid on an
hourly basis. Store managers, assistant managers and sales associates are
eligible for monthly and semi-annual bonuses based on achieving targeted goals
for their store&#8217;s sales increases and shrinkage control.
The Company constantly strives to improve its training programs to develop
associates. Over 80% of store and field management are promoted from within,
allowing the Company to internally staff an expanding store base. The Company
has training programs at each level of store operations. New store managers are
trained in training stores managed by experienced associates who have achieved
superior results in meeting the Company&#8217;s goals for store sales, payroll
expense and shrinkage control. The type and extent of district manager training
varies depending on whether the district manager is promoted from within or
recruited from outside the Company.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Store Locations" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Most of the
Company&#8217;s stores are located in the southeastern United States in a variety of
markets
ranging from small towns to large metropolitan areas with trade area
populations of 20,000 or more. Stores average approximately 4,500 square feet
in size.
All of the
Company&#8217;s stores are leased. Approximately 97% are located in strip shopping
centers and 3% in enclosed shopping malls. The Company typically locates stores
in strip shopping centers anchored by a national discounter, primarily Wal-Mart Supercenters, or market-dominant grocery stores. The Company&#8217;s strip center locations
provide ample parking and shopping convenience for its customers.
The
Company&#8217;s store development activities consist of opening new stores in new and
existing markets and relocating selected existing stores to more desirable
locations in the same market area. The following table sets forth information
with respect to the Company&#8217;s development activities since fiscal 2013:

The Company does not expect
to open new stores during fiscal 2018. The Company anticipates closing up to 34
stores.
The Company periodically
reviews its store base to determine whether any particular store should be
closed based on its sales trends and profitability. The Company intends to
continue this review process to identify underperforming stores.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Credit and Layaway" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;"></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Credit Card Program" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company offers its own credit card, which accounted for
3.3%, 3.4% and 3.6% of retail sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company&#8217;s net bad debt expense was 3.8%, 3.5% and 3.2% of credit sales in
fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Customers applying for the Company&#8217;s credit card are
approved for credit if they have a satisfactory credit record and the Company
has considered the customer&#8217;s ability to make the required minimum payment.&#160;
Customers are required to make minimum monthly payments based on their account
balances. If the balance is not paid in full each month, the Company assesses
the customer a finance charge. If payments are not received on time, the customer
is assessed a late fee subject to regulatory limits.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Layaway Plan" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">Under the Company&#8217;s layaway plan, merchandise is set aside
for customers who agree to make periodic payments. The Company adds a
nonrefundable administrative fee to each layaway sale. If no payment is made within
four weeks, the customer is considered to have defaulted, and the merchandise
is returned to the selling floor and again offered for sale, often at a reduced
price. All payments made by customers who subsequently default on their layaway
purchase are returned to the customer upon request, less the administrative fee
and a restocking fee.
The Company defers recognition of layaway sales to the
accounting period when the customer picks up and completely pays for layaway
merchandise.&#160; Administrative fees are recognized in the period in which the layaway
is initiated.&#160; Recognition of restocking fees occurs in the accounting period
when the customer defaults on the layaway purchase. Layaway sales represented
approximately 4.0%, 4.4% and 4.7% of retail sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
<company_defined_section title="Information Technology Systems" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The
Company&#8217;s information technology systems provide daily financial and
merchandising information that is used by management to enhance the timeliness
and effectiveness of purchasing and pricing decisions. Management uses a daily
report comparing actual sales with planned sales and a weekly ranking report to
monitor and control purchasing decisions. Weekly reports are also produced
which reflect sales, weeks of supply of inventory and other critical data by
product categories, by store
and by various levels of
responsibility reporting. Purchases are made based on projected sales, but can
be modified to accommodate unexpected increases or decreases in demand for a
particular item.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Competition" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The women&#8217;s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. The Company believes
that the principal competitive factors in its industry include merchandise
assortment and presentation, fashion, price, store location and customer
service. The Company competes with retail chains that operate similar women&#8217;s
apparel specialty stores. In addition, the Company competes with mass
merchandise chains, discount store chains, major department stores, off-price
retailers and internet-based retailers.&#160; Although we believe we compete
favorably with respect to the principal competitive factors described above,
many of our direct and indirect competitors are well-established national,
regional or local chains, and some have substantially greater financial,
marketing and other resources.&#160; The Company expects its stores in larger cities
and metropolitan areas to face more intense competition.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Seasonality" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Due to the seasonal nature of the retail business, the Company has historically
experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its
revenues, operating income and net income.&#160; Results of a period shorter than a
full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year.&#160;
Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between
periods.&#160; See Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding our quarterly results of operations for the last two
fiscal years.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Regulation" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">A variety of laws affect the revolving credit card program offered by the
Company. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of
2009 (&#8220;The Act&#8221;) amended the Truth in Lending Act to establish fair and transparent
practices relating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit
plan.&#160; The Act contained provisions addressing matters such as change in terms,
notices, limits on fees, rate increases, payment allocation and account
disclosures.&#160; The Act requires creditors to provide consumers with account
disclosures that are timely and in a form that is readily understandable.&#160; The
Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires certain disclosures to
potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny
credit. The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation&#160;B
promulgated thereunder prohibit lenders from discrimination against any credit
applicants, establish guidelines for gathering and evaluating credit
information and require written notification when credit is denied.&#160; Regulation
AA, Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices, establishes consumer
complaint procedures and defines unfair or deceptive practices in extending
credit to consumers.&#160; The Federal Trade Commission has adopted or proposed
various trade regulation rules dealing with unfair credit and collection
practices and the preservation of consumers&#8217; claims and defenses. The Company
is also subject to the U.S. Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, which require
the Company to monitor account holders and account transactions, respectively.
Additionally, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Company to disclose to
its customers the Company&#8217;s privacy policy as it relates to a customer&#8217;s
non-public personal information.
The recently enacted Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Tax Act&#8221;) significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax
law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%,
imposing a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;) and
implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time
transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
We have estimated the impact of the newly enacted law
incorporating assumptions made based upon our current interpretation of the Tax
Act. The actual impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to,
among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in
interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued and
actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act, as allowed under Staff
Accounting Bulletin No.118 (&#8220;SAB 118&#8221;).
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Associates" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">As of February 3, 2018, the Company employed approximately 10,500 full-time and
part-time associates. The Company also employs additional part-time associates
during the peak retailing seasons. The Company is not a party to any collective
bargaining agreements and considers its associate relations to be good.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></item><item title="Item 1A." parsing_type="item;"><company_defined_section title="Risk Factors:" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks.&#160; You should
carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information
contained in this report, including the disclosures under &#8220;Forward-looking
Information&#8221; above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in
our common stock.&#160; If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur, our
business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and
adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you
could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock.&#160; The risks and
uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us.&#160;
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business
operating results and financial condition.
<company_defined_section title="Risks Relating To Our Business:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially suffer." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Customer
tastes and fashion trends, particularly for women&#8217;s apparel, are volatile, tend
to change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty.&#160; Our success depends
in part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond to
changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner.&#160;
Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond to
changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our
merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations
and our image with our customers.&#160; If we miscalculate either the market for our
merchandise or our customers&#8217; tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required
to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over
cost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of
operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of operations." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate in
the future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customer
preferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather and economic
conditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the
applicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are
not able to accurately predict customers&#8217; preferences for our fashion items, we
may have too much inventory which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are
unable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up with
inventory shortages resulting in missed sales. A decrease
in comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may
adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Existing and increased competition in the women&#8217;s retail apparel industry may negatively impact our business,   results of operations, financial condition and market share." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">The women&#8217;s retail apparel industry
is highly competitive.&#160;&#160;We compete primarily with discount stores,
mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores
and internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greater
financial, marketing and other resources than we have.&#160;&#160;Many of our
competitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices.&#160; In some
cases our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significant
market presence.&#160;&#160;In addition, our competitors also compete for the
same retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experience
pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to open
new stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially and
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problems affecting the Company&#8217;s merchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">A
significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining
merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign
sources.&#160; As a result, political, financial or other forms of instability or
other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting our
supply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the
imposition of additional regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs,
taxes or governmental policies regarding these matters or other factors
affecting the availability or cost of imports, could cause significant delays
or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Our
costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of
the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold.
Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.&#160; In addition, increased energy and transportation costs
have caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adverse
changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise is
transported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of our
supply chain which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased
costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through which
our products move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries
or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those
goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones
we now sell.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Our
sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centers
where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop.&#160; In addition, our
ability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to
secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations.&#160; Centers where we
currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely
affected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly
affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores,
changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping
preferences.&#160;&#160;To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shopping
preferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores in
desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense.
A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where we
generally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centers
and locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, limiting our
ability to open new stores, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduce
our sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the Company&#8217;s specification may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Our dependence on third-party vendors to
manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our
vendors will fail to perform as we expect.&#160; For example, the deterioration in
any of our key vendors&#8217; financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise
in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow
our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including
compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us to
operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks.&#160; If we are not
able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with
merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect,
our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected.&#160; Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United
States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and
compliance risks, as discussed below under &#8220;Our business operations subject us
to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory
enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities,
divert our management&#8217;s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.&#8221;
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may present increased legal and operational risks." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Our
experience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia is
limited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandise
production to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company&#8217;s
specifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations
and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further,
the activities conducted by our sourcing office outside the United States
further subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and
international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this
&#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, in particular below under &#8220;Our business operations
subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and
regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or
liabilities, divert our management&#8217;s attention or otherwise adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition.&#8221;
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Consumer
spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are
affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions and
uncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties (such as those currently
being debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies),
levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and
other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the
availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions
of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any
perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively
may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits.
Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties
regarding
them also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items,
such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our
merchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and results
of operations.&#160; In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual
economic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or
terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may also
dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer
spending.&#160; Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, which may impact
our ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of raw
materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, as
well as other factors.&#160; Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to
have increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and
benefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandise
costs to the Company. Due to the Company&#8217;s limited flexibility in price point,
the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer,
which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">We rely on our existing information
technology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning,
replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management.&#160;
In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technology
systems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems,
including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales,
banking, inventory and fixed assets.&#160; Despite the precautions we take, our
information systems may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerous
events, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather
conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber attacks, acts of war
or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control or
that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our
information technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improve
such systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improving
these systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information
technology systems may also disrupt our operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">The distribution of our products is centralized in one
distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our
network of third-party freight carriers.&#160; The merchandise we purchase is
shipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipment
to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our
third-party freight carriers.&#160; If the distribution center or our third-party
freight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any
reason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described under &#8220;A failure
or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely
affect our business,&#8221; our operations would likely be seriously disrupted.&#160; Such
problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of
our ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problem
generally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center or
deliver goods to our stores.&#160; As a result, we could incur significantly higher
costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our
stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distribution
center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and" parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;"></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="financial condition." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;"></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">The Company&#8217;s long-term
business strategy includes growth through the development of new store
concepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures and
management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated
benefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipated
amounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs
related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores
are not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. If
we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="A security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operation, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">The protection of employee, Company and customer data is
critical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programming
error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or other
unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, including
but not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiable
information, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it to
remediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its
operations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial
condition. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidential
information, which are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there is
no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of such
information. If any such compromise or unauthorized disclosure of this
information were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash
flows.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We are subject to payment-related risks." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="-" parsing_type="emphasis;">party credit cards, our own branded
credit cards, debit cards, gift cards and physical bank checks. For existing
and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we may become subject to
additional regulations and compliance requirements
(including obligations
to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased
costs and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods), as well as fraud.
For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay
interchange and other fees, which may
increase over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We
rely on third-party service providers for payment processing services,
including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could
disrupt our business if these third-party
service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.
We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data
security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be
reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail
to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are
breached or comprom
ised, we may be liable for card-
issuing banks&#8217; costs, subject to fines
and higher transaction fees
. In addition we may
lose our ability to accept credit and
debit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfers
or facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="." parsing_type="emphasis;"><company_defined_section title="The Company&#8217;s failure to successfully operate its e-commerce website or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and our business." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Although the Company's e-commerce platform provides
another channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers the
on-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base,
it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in
the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our website, customer contact
center or our distribution center, including system failures caused by
telecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our present
system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error.&#160;
Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security or
data breaches involving the unauthorized disclosure of customer information, as
discussed above under &#8220;A security breach that results in unauthorized
disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect
our costs, reputation and results of operations.&#8221; We are also subject to risk
related to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as
shipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns
or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet the
challenges of operating an e-commerce website or fulfilling customer
expectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial condition." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">From time to time the Company is involved in
litigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise from
our normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, and
could require significant management time. The Company&#8217;s periodic evaluation of
litigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discovery
of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known
to us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We may
also be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions or
settlements of disputes may negatively impact our business and our financial
condition.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and our financial condition." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Like most retailers, we experience
significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales
associates
and managers.&#160; Because our continued store growth will require the hiring and
training of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train new
store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in the
turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our
recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our
store operating efficiency and productivity.&#160; We compete for qualified store
associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companies
in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financial
resources than we do.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="." parsing_type="emphasis;">If
we are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract,
train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to
service our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which could
adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
<company_defined_section title="Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management&#8217;s attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Our operations are subject to federal, state and local
laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations
relating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source our
merchandise and operate our sourcing offices.&#160; Our business is also subject to
regulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign
jurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for
resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisen
and may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include,
among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercial
disputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injury
claims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and international
regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and
permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data
protection laws, environmental laws, records and information management
regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting on
the Company&#8217;s behalf may result in significant investigation costs and severe
criminal or civil sanctions.&#160; These and other liabilities to which we may be
subject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial
condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues,
which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant
management time.&#160; The Company may also be subject to regulatory review and
audits, which results may have the potential to materially and adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are
subject to change from time to time.&#160; Compliance and litigation matters could
result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect
on our operations and our reputation.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="If we fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">We believe that our &#8220;Cato&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s Fashion&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s
Fashion Metro&#8221; and &#8220;Versona&#8221; trademarks are integral to our store designs,
brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty.
Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office (&#8220;PTO&#8221;) and have also registered, or applied for registration of,
additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our
business, we cannot assure that these registrations will prevent imitation of
our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label
merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by
others. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise
generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries
a negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="We may experience market conditions that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Our short-term investments
and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state,
municipal and corporate debt securities.&#160; The value of those securities may be
impacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings,
rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality of
market credit and liquidity.&#160; As federal, state and municipal entities struggle
with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of our
ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issues
declines.&#160; Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect our
financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business
strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents
at financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits.&#160;
An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting the
financial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us to
experience losses on our deposits.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">As
a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of
the SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and related
rule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the next
several years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of
these rules and regulations have, and may continue to, increase our compliance
costs and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. To
satisfy the SEC&#8217;s rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and
enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly and
time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently.&#160;We cannot give
assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control
over financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate
in the future.&#160;Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and
regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may
become subject in the future, as a public company could have an adverse
material impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of our
common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these requirements, particularly
with new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to be implemented,
could significantly increase our compliance costs.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Unusual weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters or similar
events can influence customer trends and shopping habits.&#160; For example, heavy
rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make
it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our
sales and profitability.&#160; Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable
weather conditions.&#160; For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm
temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season
could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable
conditions.&#160; Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather
conditions would adversely affect our business.&#160; The occurrence or threat of
extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts,
outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases or other
catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewise
disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which could materially and adversely
affect us.

retail apparel industry.&#160; As a result, our stores typically generate a higher
percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second
quarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters.&#160; Accordingly, our
operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of
results to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly
fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="The interests of a principal shareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">As of March 27, 2018, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer, beneficially controlled approximately 44.5% of the voting power of our
common stock.&#160; As a result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly
influence substantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders,
including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other
business combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato may
have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in a
way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their
interests.&#160; In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Cato
could have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change in
control of the Company, which could depress the market price of our common
stock.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile." parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely to
continue to be, subject to significant volatility.&#160;&#160;A variety of
factors may cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhaps
substantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this
report, as well as the following: low trading volume; general market
fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or
the inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments related
to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general
conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retail
industry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or
global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in
financial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities
analysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding
short-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments;
significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings.&#160;
Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market for
shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experienced
extreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating
performance of those companies.&#160;&#160;Such fluctuations and market
volatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affect
the market price of our common stock.

<company_defined_section title="Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Retail sales decreased by 11.1% to $842.0
million in fiscal 2017 compared to $947.4 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease
in retail sales in fiscal 2017 was largely attributable to a same-store sales
decrease of 12%, partially offset by a small increase in non-comparable store
sales and an additional week of sales in 2017. Fiscal 2017 had 53 weeks versus
52 weeks in fiscal 2016. &#160;Same-store sales includes stores that have been open
more than 15 months.&#160; Stores that have been relocated or expanded are also
included in the same-store sales calculation after they have been open more
than 15 months. &#160;In fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, e-commerce sales were less
than 2% of total sales and same-store sales. The method of calculating same-store
sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our same-store sales
calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
other companies.&#160; Total revenues, comprised of retail sales and other revenue
(principally finance charges and late fees on customer accounts receivable,
layaway fees and shipping charged to customers for e-commerce purchases),
decreased by 11.1% to $850.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $956.6 million
in fiscal 2016. The Company operated 1,351 stores at February 3, 2018 compared
to 1,371 stores operated at January 28, 2017.
In fiscal 2017, the Company opened six
new stores, relocated three stores and closed 26 stores.
Other revenue in total decreased to $8.0
million in fiscal 2017 from $9.2 million in fiscal 2016.&#160; The decrease resulted
primarily from lower finance charges and lower layaway charges, partially
offset by increased shipping charges for e-commerce purchases.
Credit revenue of $4.2 million
represented 0.5% of total revenue in fiscal 2017, a decrease compared to fiscal
2016 credit revenue of $4.9 million or 0.5% of total revenue.&#160; The decrease in
credit revenue was primarily due to reductions in finance and late charge
income as a result of lower accounts receivable balances.&#160; Credit revenue is
comprised of interest earned on the Company&#8217;s private label credit card
portfolio and related fee income. Related expenses include principally bad debt
expense, payroll, postage and other administrative expenses and totaled $3.0
million in fiscal 2017 compared to $3.2 million in fiscal 2016.&#160; See Note 14 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a schedule of credit-related
expenses. Total credit segment income before taxes decreased $0.5 million from $1.7
million in fiscal 2016 to $1.2 million in fiscal 2017 due to lower credit
revenue. Total credit income of $1.2 million in fiscal 2017 represented 7.5% of
total income before taxes of $16.0 million compared to total credit income of $1.7
million in fiscal 2016, which represented 3.5% of fiscal 2016 total income
before taxes of $49.1 million.
Cost of goods sold was $553.1
million, or 65.7% of retail sales, in fiscal 2017 compared to $602.0 million,
or 63.5% of retail sales, in fiscal 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold as
a percentage of sales
resulted
primarily from increased sales of marked down product and
increases in buying and occupancy costs.
Cost of goods sold includes merchandise costs, net of discounts
and allowances, buying costs, distribution costs, occupancy costs, freight and
inventory shrinkage. Net merchandise costs and in-bound freight are capitalized
as inventory costs. Buying and distribution costs include payroll,
payroll-related costs and operating expenses for the buying departments and
distribution center. Occupancy expenses include rent, real estate taxes,
insurance, common area maintenance, utilities and maintenance for stores and
distribution facilities.&#160; Total gross margin dollars (retail sales less cost of
goods sold and excluding depreciation) decreased by 16.3% to $288.9 million in
fiscal 2017 from $345.4 million in fiscal 2016. Gross margin as presented may
not be comparable to that of other companies.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Retail sales decreased by 5.4% to $947.4 million
in fiscal 2016 compared to $1,001.4 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in
retail sales in fiscal 2016 was largely attributable to a same-store sales
decrease of 6% and partially offset by a small increase in non-comparable store
sales. Same-store sales includes stores that have been open more than 15
months.&#160; Stores that have been relocated or expanded are also included in
the same-store sales calculation after they have been open more than 15 months.
&#160;In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, e-
commerce sales
were less than 2% of total sales and same-store sales. The method of
calculating same-store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result,
our same-store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies.&#160; Total revenues, comprised of retail
sales and other revenue (principally finance charges and late fees on customer
accounts receivable, layaway fees and shipping charged to customers for
e-commerce purchases), decreased by 5.4% to $956.6 million in fiscal 2016
compared to $1,011.1 million in fiscal 2015. The Company operated 1,371 stores
at January 28, 2017 compared to 1,372 stores operated at January 30, 2016.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Other than operating leases in the
ordinary course of business, the Company is not a party to any off-balance
sheet arrangements.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Critical Accounting Policies" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company&#8217;s accounting policies are more fully described
in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of the Company&#8217;s
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates
and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects
cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of
estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will
differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the
financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the
preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements include the allowance for
doubtful accounts, inventory shrinkage, the calculation of potential asset
impairment, workers&#8217; compensation, general and auto insurance liabilities,
reserves relating to self-insured health insurance, and uncertain tax
positions.
The Company&#8217;s critical accounting
policies and estimates are discussed with the Audit Committee.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Allowance for Doubtful Accounts" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company evaluates the
collectability of accounts receivable and records an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on the accounts receivable aging and estimates of actual
write-offs. The allowance is reviewed for adequacy and adjusted, as necessary,
on a quarterly basis. The Company also provides for estimated uncollectible
late fees charged based on historical write-offs. The Company&#8217;s financial
results can be impacted by changes in bad debt write-off experience and the
aging of the accounts receivable portfolio.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Merchandise Inventories" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company&#8217;s inventory is valued
using the weighted-average cost method and is stated at the net realizable
value. Physical inventories are conducted throughout the year to calculate
actual shrinkage and inventory on hand. Estimates based on actual shrinkage
results are used to estimate inventory shrinkage, which is accrued for the
period between the last physical inventory and the financial reporting date.
The Company regularly reviews its inventory levels to identify slow moving
merchandise and uses markdowns to clear slow moving inventory.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Lease Accounting" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term as defined in ASC 840 -
<company_defined_section title="Leases." parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">Our lease
agreements generally provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease term
or rent holidays, including rental payments commencing
at a date other than the date of initial occupancy.&#160; We include any rent
escalation and rent holidays in our straight-line rent expense.&#160; In addition,
we record landlord allowances for normal tenant improvements as deferred rent,
which is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheets.&#160; This deferred rent is amortized over the lease term as a reduction of
rent expense.&#160; Also, leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
related lease term.&#160; See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information on the Company&#8217;s accounting for its leases.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The
Company primarily invests in property and equipment in connection with the
opening and remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware. The
Company periodically reviews its store locations and estimates the
recoverability of its assets, recording an impairment charge for the amount by
which carrying value exceeds fair value, if necessary, when the Company decides
to close the store or otherwise determines that future estimated cash flows
associated with those assets will not be sufficient to recover the carrying
value. This determination is based on a number of factors, including the
store&#8217;s historical operating results and cash flows, estimated future sales
growth, real estate development in the area and perceived local market conditions
that can be difficult to predict and may be subject to change. In addition, the
Company regularly evaluates its computer-related and other long-lived assets
and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is
expected to be replaced or has limited future value. When assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or
amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in income for that period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the Company&#8217;s current year impairment
charges.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Insurance Liabilities" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The
Company is primarily self-insured for healthcare, workers&#8217; compensation and
general liability costs. These costs are significant primarily due to the large
number of the Company&#8217;s retail locations and associates. The Company&#8217;s
self-insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims
filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid
against such claims, and are not discounted. Management reviews current and
historical claims data in developing its estimates. The Company also uses
information provided by outside actuaries with respect to healthcare, workers&#8217;
compensation and general liability claims. If the underlying facts and
circumstances of the claims change or the historical experience upon which
insurance provisions are recorded is not indicative of future trends, then the
Company may be required to make adjustments to the provision for insurance
costs that could be material to the Company&#8217;s reported financial condition and
results of operations. Historically, actual results have not significantly
deviated from estimates.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Uncertain Tax Positions" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;">The
Company records liabilities for uncertain tax positions principally related to
state income taxes as of the balance sheet date.&#160; These liabilities reflect the
Company&#8217;s best estimate of its ultimate income tax liability based on the tax
codes, regulations, and pronouncements of the jurisdictions in which we do
business.&#160; Estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments
regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many
jurisdictions.&#160; Despite the Company&#8217;s belief that the estimates and judgments
are reasonable, differences between the estimated and actual tax liabilities
can and do exist from time to time.&#160; These differences may arise from
settlements of tax audits, expiration of the statute of limitations, or the
evolution and application of the various jurisdictional tax codes and
regulations.&#160; Any differences will be recorded in the period in which they
become known and could have a material effect on the results of operations in
the period the adjustment is recorded.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Revenue Recognition" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The
Company has consistently maintained a strong liquidity position. Cash provided
by operating activities during fiscal 2017 was $36.0 million as compared to
$72.1&#160;million in fiscal 2016. These amounts have enabled the Company to
fund its regular operating needs, capital expenditure program, cash dividend
payments and selective repurchases of the Company&#8217;s common
stock.
Cash provided by operating
activities for these periods was primarily generated by earnings adjusted for
the change due to depreciation and changes in working capital and share-based
compensation.&#160; The decrease of $36.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal
2016 is primarily due to a decrease in net income and accounts payable
partially offset by a decrease in inventory.
The Company believes that its cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash flows from
operations and borrowings available under its revolving credit agreement, will
be adequate to fund the Company&#8217;s proposed capital expenditures, dividends and
other operating requirements for fiscal 2018 and for the foreseeable future.
<company_defined_section title="At February 3, 2018, the" parsing_type="emphasis;">Company had working capital of $233.4&#160;million compared to $271.9&#160;million
and $292.6 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="At February 3, 2018, the Company" parsing_type="emphasis;">had an unsecured revolving credit agreement, which
provided for borrowings of up to
$35.0&#160;million less the balance of revocable letters of credit discussed
below. The revolving credit agreement is committed until August 2019. The
credit agreement contains various financial covenants and limitations,
including the maintenance of specific financial ratios with which the Company
was in compliance as of February 3, 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding
under this credit facility as of the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018 or the
fiscal year ended January 28, 2017.
The Company had no outstanding
revocable letters of credit relating to purchase commitments at February 3,
2018, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016.
Expenditures for property and
equipment totaled $11.1 million, $27.3 million and $26.5 million in
fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
expenditures for fiscal 2017 were primarily for store development and investments
in new technology.&#160; In fiscal 2018, the Company is planning to invest
approximately $7.2 million in capital expenditures.

these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting
,
included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A
.&#160; Our responsibility is to
express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated
financial statements and on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits.&#160; We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our
audits i
n accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB.&#160; Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial
statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.&#160; Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.&#160; Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial
statements.&#160; Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk.&#160; Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
<company_defined_section title="Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting" parsing_type="i-tag;b-tag;">A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.&#160; A
company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)&#160;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&#160;provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)&#160;provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;"></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Principles of Consolidation:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of The Cato Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the
&#8220;Company&#8221;). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Description of Business and Fiscal" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;"></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Year:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company has two reportable segments
&#8212; the operation of a fashion specialty stores segment (&#8220;Retail Segment&#8221;) and a
credit card segment (&#8220;Credit Segment&#8221;). The apparel specialty stores operate
under the names &#8220;Cato,&#8221; &#8220;Cato Fashions,&#8221; &#8220;Cato Plus,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s Fashion,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s
Fashion Metro&#8221; and &#8220;Versona,&#8221; including e-commerce websites. The stores are
located primarily in strip shopping centers principally in the southeastern
United States. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January
31 of the subsequent year.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Use of Estimates:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The
preparation of the Company&#8217;s financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company&#8217;s financial
statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory shrinkage,
the calculation of potential asset impairment, workers&#8217; compensation, general
and auto insurance liabilities, reserves relating to self-insured health
insurance, and uncertain tax positions.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Cash and Cash Equivalents:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Short-Term Investments:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Investments
with original maturities beyond three months are classified as short-term
investments. See Note 3 for the Company&#8217;s estimated fair value of, and other
information regarding, its short-term investments.
The Company&#8217;s
short-term investments are all classified as available-for-sale. As they are
available for current operations, they are classified on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as Current Assets. Available-for-sale securities are carried at
fair value, with unrealized gains and temporary losses, net of income taxes, reported
as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. Other than temporary
declines in the fair value of investments are recorded as a reduction in the
cost of the investments in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and a
reduction of Interest and other income in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The cost of debt securities is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.
The amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and realized gains and
losses are included in Interest and other income.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Restricted Cash and Investments:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company had $3.7 million and $3.7 million in escrow at
February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively, as security and collateral
for administration of the Company&#8217;s self-insured workers&#8217; compensation and
general liability coverage which is reported as Restricted cash and investments
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Supplemental Cash Flow Information:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Income tax payments, net of refunds received, for the fiscal
years ended February 3, 2018, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 were $4,356,000,
$14,118,000 and $29,198,000, respectively.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Inventories:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Merchandise inventories are stated at the net realizable value as
determined by the weighted-average cost method.
<company_defined_section title="THE CATO CORPORATION" parsing_type="all caps;b-tag;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued)" parsing_type="b-tag;b-tag;"></company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Property and Equipment:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Property and equipment are recorded at
cost, including land. Maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as
incurred; renewals and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation is determined
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets excluding leasehold improvements.&#160; Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term.&#160; For leases with
renewal periods at the Company&#8217;s option, the Company generally uses the
original lease term plus reasonably assured renewal option periods (generally
one five-year option period) to determine estimated useful lives.&#160; Typical
estimated useful lives are as follows:
Estimated
Classification
Useful Lives
Land improvements
10 years
Buildings
30-40 years
Leasehold improvements
5-10 years
Fixtures and equipment
3-10 years
Information technology equipment and software
3-10 years
Aircraft
20 years
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company invests in property and equipment primarily in connection with the
opening and remodeling of stores and in computer software and hardware. The
Company periodically reviews its store locations and estimates the
recoverability of its assets, recording an impairment charge for the amount by
which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, if necessary, when
the Company decides to close the store or otherwise determines that future
estimated cash flows associated with those assets will not be sufficient to
recover the carrying value. This determination is based on a number of factors,
including the store&#8217;s historical operating results and cash flows, estimated
future sales growth, real estate development in the area and perceived local
market conditions that can be difficult to predict and may be subject to
change. Asset impairment charges incurred in fiscal 2017 were $7,698,000.&#160;
Asset impairment charges incurred in fiscal 2016 were $13,561,000. Asset
impairment charges incurred in fiscal 2015 were $1,917,000.&#160; In addition, the
Company regularly evaluates its computer-related and other long-lived assets
and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is expected
to be replaced or has limited future value. When assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or
amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in income for that period.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Other Assets" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Other
assets are comprised of long-term assets, primarily insurance contracts related
to deferred compensation assets and land held for investment purposes.

determines the classification of leases consistent with ASC 840 -
<company_defined_section title="Leases" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">.&#160;
The Company leases all of its retail stores.&#160; Most lease agreements contain
construction allowances and rent escalations.&#160; For purposes of recognizing
incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms
of the leases, including renewal periods considered reasonably assured, the
Company begins amortization as of the initial possession date which is when the
Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for
intended use.
For
construction allowances, the Company records a deferred rent liability in Other
noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the
deferred rent over the term of the respective lease as a reduction to Cost of
goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
For
scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments
commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company
records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
leases. Deferred landlord allowance and deferred step rent of $23,495,000 are
recorded in other noncurrent liabilities at the end of February 3, 2018.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Revenue Recognition" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company recognizes sales at the point of purchase when the customer takes
possession of the merchandise and pays for the purchase, generally with cash or
credit. Sales from purchases made with Cato credit, gift cards and layaway
sales from stores are also recorded when the customer takes possession of the
merchandise.&#160; E-commerce sales are recorded when the risk of loss is
transferred to the customer. Gift cards are recorded as deferred revenue until
they are redeemed or forfeited.&#160; Layaway sales are recorded as deferred revenue
until the customer takes possession or forfeits the merchandise.&#160; Gift cards do
not have expiration dates.&#160; A provision is made for estimated merchandise
returns based on sales volumes and the Company&#8217;s experience; actual returns
have not varied materially from historical amounts. Amounts related to shipping
and handling billed to customers in a sales transaction are classified as
revenue and the costs related to shipping product to customers (billed and
accrued) are classified as Cost of goods sold.
In fiscal
2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $1,380,000, $3,434,000 and
$523,000, respectively, of income on unredeemed gift cards (&#8220;gift card
breakage&#8221;) as a component of Other income on the Consolidated Statements of
Income and Comprehensive Income. See Note 2 for further
information
on miscellaneous income. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company changed
its estimate for recognizing gift card breakage income, changing the dormancy
period to 24 months of inactivity from 60 months of inactivity. Gift card
breakage is determined after 24 months when the likelihood of the remaining
balances being redeemed is remote based on our historical redemption data and
there is no legal obligation to remit the remaining balances to relevant
jurisdictions.
<company_defined_section title="THE CATO CORPORATION" parsing_type="all caps;b-tag;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued)" parsing_type="b-tag;b-tag;">The Company
offers its own credit card to customers. All credit activity is performed by
the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries. None of the credit card receivables
are secured. Finance revenue is recognized as earned under the interest method
and late charges are recognized in the month in which they are assessed, net of
provisions for estimated uncollectible amounts. The Company evaluates the
collectability of accounts receivable and records an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on the aging of accounts and estimates of actual write-offs.
Late fees are recognized as earned, less provisions for estimated uncollectible
fees.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Cost of Goods Sold:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Cost of goods sold includes merchandise costs, net of discounts
and allowances, buying costs, distribution costs, occupancy costs, freight, and
inventory shrinkage. Net merchandise costs and in-bound freight are capitalized
as inventory costs. Buying and distribution costs include payroll,
payroll-related costs and operating expenses for our buying departments and
distribution center. Occupancy expenses include rent, real estate taxes,
insurance, common area maintenance, utilities and maintenance for stores and
distribution facilities. Buying, distribution, occupancy and internal transfer
costs are treated as period costs and are not capitalized as part of inventory.
The direct costs associated with shipping goods to customers are recorded as a
component of Cost of goods sold.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Advertising:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Advertising expense was approximately $5,558,000, $6,868,000 and $7,074,000 for
the fiscal years ended February 3, 2018, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016,
respectively.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Stock Repurchase Program:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">For fiscal year
ending February 3, 2018, the Company had&#160; 612,406 shares remaining in open
authorizations. There is no specified expiration date for the Company&#8217;s
repurchase program. Share repurchases are recorded in Retained earnings, net of
par value. As of March 27, 2018, the Company repurchased 31,000 shares for $408,000,
primarily to offset dilution from its equity compensation plans.
<company_defined_section title="Earnings Per Share:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;emphasis;">Earnings
Per Share:
ASC 260 -
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Earnings Per Share" parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">, requires dual presentation of basic EPS and diluted EPS on the face
of all income statements for all entities with complex capital structures.&#160; The
Company has presented one basic EPS and one diluted EPS amount for all common
shares in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive
Income.&#160; While the Company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation provides the right for
the Board of Directors to declare dividends on Class A shares without
declaration of commensurate dividends on Class B shares, the Company has
historically paid the same dividends to both Class A and Class B shareholders
and the Board of Directors has resolved to continue this practice.&#160;
Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s allocation of income for purposes of EPS computation
is the same for Class A and Class B shares and the EPS amounts reported herein
are applicable to both Class A and Class B shares.
Basic EPS is computed as net income
less earnings allocated to non-vested equity awards divided by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period.&#160; Diluted EPS
reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable
through stock options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
The following table reflects the
basic and diluted EPS calculations for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2018,
January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016:

</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Vendor Allowances:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company receives certain
allowances from vendors primarily related to purchase discounts and markdown
and damage allowances. All allowances are reflected in Cost of goods sold as
earned when the related products are sold.&#160; Cash consideration received from a
vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the purchase cost of merchandise and is
reflected as a reduction of inventory.&#160; The Company does not receive
cooperative advertising allowances.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Income Taxes:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. Income
taxes are provided based on the asset and liability method of accounting,
whereby deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company&#8217;s assets and
liabilities.
As of the
first quarter of 2017, the Company changed its estimates for unrecognized
benefits of uncertain tax positions. As a result of this change in estimate, during
the first quarter of 2017, Income tax expense decreased by $1.5 million, Other
noncurrent liabilities decreased by $2.5 million, and Noncurrent deferred
income taxes decreased by $1.0 million.
Unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are established in
accordance with ASC 740 when, despite the fact that the tax return positions
are supportable, the Company believes these positions may be challenged and the
results are uncertain.&#160; The Company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing
facts and circumstances.&#160; Potential accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits within operations are recognized as a component of
Income before income taxes.
The recently enacted Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act (the &#8220;Tax Act&#8221;) significantly revised U.S. corporate income
tax law by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21%
and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time
transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The
Company has estimated the impact of the newly enacted law incorporating
assumptions made based upon its current interpretation of the Tax Act.
In addition, the Tax Act
implemented a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (&#8220;GILTI&#8221;).
The Company has elected to account for GILTI tax in the period in which it is
incurred. The Company is currently in the process of analyzing this provision
and, as a result, is not yet able to reasonably estimate its effect. Therefore,
the Company has not made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in its
consolidated financial statements and has not made a policy decision regarding
whether
to record deferred tax on GILTI.
<company_defined_section title="THE CATO CORPORATION" parsing_type="all caps;b-tag;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued)" parsing_type="b-tag;b-tag;">Due to the complexities
involved in accounting for the enactment of the Tax Act, SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin 118 (&#8220;SAB 118&#8221;) allows companies to record provisional estimates of
the impacts of the Tax Act during a measurement period of up to one year.
The Company will continue
to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on its consolidated
financial statements.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Store Opening Costs:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">Costs relating to the opening of new stores or the
relocating or
expanding of existing stores are expensed as incurred.&#160; A portion of
construction, design, and site selection costs are capitalized to new,
relocated and remodeled stores.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Closed Store Lease Obligations:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">At the time stores are closed, provisions are made
for the rentals
required to be paid over the remaining lease terms on a discounted cash flow
basis, reduced by any expected sublease rentals.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Insurance:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company is self-insured with respect to employee health care, workers&#8217;
compensation and general liability. The Company&#8217;s self-insurance liabilities
are based on the total estimated cost of claims filed and estimates of claims
incurred but not reported, less amounts paid against such claims, and are not
discounted.&#160; Management reviews current and historical claims data in developing
its estimates. The Company has stop-loss insurance coverage for individual
claims in excess of $325,000 for employee healthcare, $350,000 for workers&#8217;
compensation and $250,000 for general liability.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Fair Value of Financial Instruments:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company&#8217;s carrying values of
financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, restricted cash and short-term investments, approximate their fair
values due to their short terms to maturity and/or their variable interest
rates.
</company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Stock Based Compensation:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company records
compensation expense associated with restricted stock and other forms of equity
compensation in accordance with ASC 718 -
<company_defined_section title="Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation." parsing_type="emphasis;i-tag;">Compensation cost associated with stock awards recognized in all years
presented includes: 1) amortization related to the remaining unvested portion
of all stock awards based on the grant date fair value and 2) adjustments for
the effects of actual forfeitures versus initial estimated forfeitures.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Recently Adopted Accounting Policies" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. This new accounting guidance
requires entities to record the differences between income tax stock expense
and book tax expense as a component of income tax expense in the income
statement. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. In the second quarter of
2016, we early adopted this new guidance. The impact on the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for fiscal year 2016
was a decrease of $739,000 to income tax expense.
In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued an accounting standards update that will simplify the measurement of
inventory for companies. The standard differentiates the valuation methods used
to measure inventory based on the type of inventory method utilized by a
company. Companies using the first-in, first-out method and the average cost
method will measure inventory at the net realizable value method to measure
inventory. Companies using the last-in, first-out method and the retail method
will use the lower of cost or market to measure inventory. The standard was
effective for
the Company&#8217;s first quarter of its 2017
fiscal year. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted the new guidance
and it did not have a material impact on the Financial Statements.
<company_defined_section title="THE CATO CORPORATION" parsing_type="all caps;b-tag;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued)" parsing_type="b-tag;b-tag;"></company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="Recent Accounting Pronouncements" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued an effective date for a new leasing standard that will require
substantially all leases to be recorded on the balance sheet. The standard is
effective for the Company&#8217;s first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year; early
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting
period. The Company is assessing what impacts this new standard will have on
its Consolidated Financial Statements and expects assets and liabilities to
increase.
In May 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update that
will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance and modify the
accounting treatment for certain costs associated with revenue generation.
The core principle of the revised revenue
recognition standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
good or services, and provides several steps to apply to achieve that
principle.&#160; In addition, the new guidance enhances disclosure requirements to
include more information about specific revenue contracts entered into by the
entity.&#160; The standard is effective for the Company&#8217;s first quarter of its 2018
fiscal year, and early adoption is permitted.&#160; The Company expects the impact
of this new standard to be immaterial.

The
Company&#8217;s investment portfolio was primarily invested in corporate bonds and tax-exempt
and taxable governmental debt securities held in managed accounts with
underlying ratings of A or better at February 3, 2018. The state, municipal and
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities have contractual maturities which
range from 1 month to 29.4 years. The U.S. Treasury Notes and Certificates of
Deposit have contractual maturities which range from 1 month to 2 months.
These securities are
classified as available-for-sale and are recorded as Short-term investments,
Restricted cash and investments and Other assets on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are carried at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses reported net of taxes in Accumulated other
comprehensive income.
Additionally, at February 3, 2018, the Company had $0.8 million of corporate
equities, which are recorded within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.&#160; At January 28, 2017, the Company had $0.7 million of corporate
equities, which are recorded within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
Level 1
category securities are measured at fair value using quoted active market
prices.&#160; Level 2 investment securities include corporate and municipal bonds
for which quoted prices may not be available on active exchanges for identical
instruments.&#160; Their fair value is principally based on market values determined
by management with assistance of a third-party pricing
service.&#160; Since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not
available, these prices are determined by the pricing service using observable
market information such as quotes from less active markets and/or quoted prices
of securities with similar characteristics, among other factors.

of life insurance policies. These life insurance policies are valued based on
the cash surrender value of the insurance contract, which is determined based
on such factors as the fair value of the underlying assets and discounted cash
flow and are therefore classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
The Level 3 liability associated with the life insurance policies represents a
deferred compensation obligation, the value of which is tracked via underlying
insurance funds, as recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. These funds are designed to mirror existing mutual
funds and money market funds that are observable and actively traded.

The Company is primarily
self-insured for healthcare.&#160; These costs are significant primarily due to the
large number of the Company&#8217;s retail locations and associates. The Company&#8217;s
self-insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims
filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported, less amounts paid
against such claims.&#160; Management reviews current and historical claims data in
developing its estimates. If the underlying facts and circumstances of the
claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends, then
the Company may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense
which could be material to the Company&#8217;s reported financial condition and
results of operations. The Company funds healthcare contributions to a
third-party provider.

The Company continues to evaluate its permanent
reinvestment assertion in light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Tax
Act&#8221;).&#160; The accounting is expected to be completed within the one-year
measurement period as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No.118 (&#8220;SAB 118&#8221;).

The
recently enacted Tax Act significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law
by, among other things, reducing the corporate income tax rate to 21% and
implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time
transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In
response to the Tax Act, the SEC issued SAB 118 which allows issuers to
recognize provisional estimates of the impact of the Tax Act in their financial
statements and adjust in the period in which the estimate
becomes
finalized, or in circumstances where estimates cannot be made, to disclose and
recognize within a one year measurement period.
</company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="THE CATO CORPORATION" parsing_type="all caps;b-tag;b-tag;"><company_defined_section title="NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS &#8212; (Continued)" parsing_type="b-tag;b-tag;">Implementation
of the Tax Act resulted in an approximate&#160;$6.2 million&#160;charge for the
revaluation of the Company&#8217;s net domestic deferred tax assets and a one-time
provisional transition tax charge of approximately&#160;$6.1 million, of which
$5.7 million is recorded in non-current liabilities. In reaching these
estimates, the Company utilized all available guidance and notices issued by
the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These amounts are to be considered
provisional and are not currently able to be finalized given the complexity of
the underlying calculations. The Company relied upon prior year legal entity
financials and return filings in the estimates of the one-time transition tax.
The Company will update and conclude its accounting as additional information
is obtained, which in many cases is contingent on the timing of issuance of
regulatory guidance.

it has four operating segments, as defined under ASC 280-10, including Cato,
It&#8217;s Fashion, Versona and Credit.&#160; As outlined in ASC 280-10, the Company
has two reportable segments: Retail and Credit.&#160; The Company has
aggregated its three retail operating segments, including e-commerce, based on
the aggregation criteria outlined in ASC 280-10, which states that two or more
operating segments may be aggregated into a single reportable segment if
aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of ASC
280-10, which require the segments have similar economic characteristics,
products, production processes, clients and methods of distribution.
The Company&#8217;s retail operating
segments have similar economic characteristics and similar operating, financial
and competitive risks.&#160; They are similar in terms of product offered, as
they all offer women&#8217;s apparel, shoes and accessories.&#160; Merchandise
inventory of the Company&#8217;s retail operating segments is sourced from the same
countries and some of the same vendors, using similar production
processes.&#160; Merchandise for the Company&#8217;s retail operating segments is
distributed to retail stores in a similar manner through the Company&#8217;s single
distribution center and is subsequently distributed to clients in a similar
manner.

Stock Based Compensation:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">As of February 3,
2018, the Company had three long-term compensation plans pursuant to which
stock-based compensation was outstanding or could be granted. The Company&#8217;s
1987 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan is for the granting of options to officers
and key employees. The 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan and 2004 Incentive
Compensation Plan are for the granting of various forms of equity-based awards,
including restricted stock and stock options for grant, to officers, directors
and key employees. Effective May 23, 2013, shares for grant were no longer
available under the 2004 Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan.
The
following table presents the number of options and shares of restricted stock
initially authorized and available for grant under each of the plans as of February

In accordance with ASC 718, the fair value of current restricted stock awards
is estimated on the date of grant based on the market price of the Company&#8217;s
stock and is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over a
five-year vesting period. As of February 3, 2018, there was $11,727,000 of total
unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards,
which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting
period of 2.0 years.&#160; The total grant date fair value of the shares recognized
as compensation expense during the twelve months ended February 3, 2018,
January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 was $4,093,000, $4,091,000 and
$4,020,000, respectively.&#160; The expenses are classified as a component of
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Income and Comprehensive Income.

The Company&#8217;s Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible
full-time employees to purchase a limited number of shares of the Company&#8217;s
Class A Common Stock during each semi-annual offering period at a 15% discount
through payroll deductions. During the twelve month period ended February 3,
2018, the Company sold 34,238 shares to employees at an average discount of
$2.50 per share under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The compensation
expense recognized for the 15% discount given under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan was approximately $86,000, $88,000 and $86,000 for fiscal years 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively.&#160; These expenses are classified as a component of
Selling, general and administrative expenses.

</company_defined_section></company_defined_section></company_defined_section><company_defined_section title="16. Commitments and Contingencies:" parsing_type="emphasis;b-tag;">The Company
is, from time to time, involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct
of our business, including litigation regarding the merchandise that we sell,
litigation regarding intellectual property, litigation instituted by persons
injured upon premises under our control, litigation with respect to various
employment matters, including alleged discrimination and wage
and hour litigation, and litigation with
present or former employees. The Company has approximately $9.3 million in
accrued litigation expense at February 3, 2018.
Although such litigation is routine
and incidental to the conduct of our business, as with any business of our size
with a significant number of employees and significant merchandise sales, such
litigation could result in large monetary awards. Based on information
currently available, management does not believe that any reasonably possible
losses arising from current pending litigation will have a material adverse
effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, given the
inherent uncertainties involved in such matters, an adverse outcome in one or
more such matters could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows in any particular reporting
period. The Company accrues for these matters when the liability is deemed
probable and reasonably estimable.
