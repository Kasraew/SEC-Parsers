Company ,&#8221; &#8220;
we ,&#8221; or &#8220;
us &#8221;) was incorporated in Nevada in February 2021 as a spin-off from Singlepoint Inc. in April 2021. We started by offering a tobacco- and nicotine-free smoking alternative called &#8220;1606 Original Hemp.&#8221; We started to sell hemp, aroma-free cigarettes, first by reselling the star brand, and eventually our own brand called &#8220;TRUZ.&#8221; The brands expanded to include &#8220;Singlez,&#8221; an individually packeted version of the TRUZ hemp cigarettes. This business has been discontinued.
In August of 2023, we decided to use our knowledge of the cannabidiol (&#8220;
CBD &#8221;) industry to move into AI chatbots specifically made for the CBD industry. We partnered with ARXT Labs to create a proprietary Chatbot using AI to answer customer questions and recommend a product based on their answers and preferences. We then signed a distribution contract with Cool Blue Distribution to sell the service to CBD companies as well as offer their CBD expertise through Cool Blue&#8217;s owner, Don Flanagan. In late 2023, we debuted our first chat bot, &#8220;chatCBDW by CBDW AI,&#8221; and began signing up customers to test and implement the bot on their CBD websites.
With our corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona, our executive team experienced in CBD products, and our board&#8217;s knowledge of the technology and AI spaces, we believe we are positioned to become the market leader for AI Bot technology.
We also see the future potential for our chatbot technology to expand beyond the CBD industry to any industry with issues with consumer questions and indecisive over product choices.&#160;This includes the solar, beauty, and auto parts industries among many others.
</section><section title="distribution" desc="Distribution" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">We are focused on signing business to use our chatbot with a monthly recuring licensing fee model. Through a combination of our website, online ads, and email campaigns targeted towards CBD brands and retailers, we have cultivated considerable interest in our company and our AI chatbot technology.
We are also using independent sales organizations (&#8220;
ISOs &#8221;) to sell the chatbot or include it in a package deal with their products. These ISOs include but are not limited to CBD distributors, website designers and builders, and payment processing services within and outside the CBD industry.
</section><section title="ourstrategy" desc="Our Strategy" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">The global artificial intelligence market has seen remarkable growth, valued at $428 billion in 2022 and projected to reach $2.25 trillion by 2030. With a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;
CAGR &#8221;) ranging from 33.2% to 38.1%, AI's global impact is undeniable, with as many as 97 million individuals expected to work in the AI sector by 2025, according to fortunebusinessinsights.com.
1
The global CBD market is positioned for exponential growth, and e-commerce is at the heart of this expansion. By tailoring our chat bots to serve this niche, we believe we are well-poised to capitalize on this extraordinary growth trajectory. Our chatbots will empower both our shareholders and business partners to thrive in an ever-expanding market. The global CBD market size was valued at $6.4 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.2% from 2023 to 2030.
2
We plan to contract with retailers and brands using a monthly licensing model. Our licensing model is designed with businesses in mind. It allows companies, particularly those in the CBD industry, to integrate our chatbots into their platforms seamlessly. This approach not only reduces the development burden on businesses but also expedites the deployment of AI-driven solutions, enhancing customer experiences without requiring extensive resources.
</section><section title="products" desc="Products" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">We develop AI chatbot&#8217;s that are specifically designed to the industry and products for a retailer or brands. The bot is trained on industry specific questions and answers to give the most accurate information to costumers&#8217; inquiries in a conversational and natural style. The bot is also uploaded with the ability to recommend products by using the conversation and costumers input to drive to a tailed product recommendation. The chatbot is tailored to the CBD industry currently but can be programmed to accommodate any consumer facing industry.

Our common stock is considered to be penny stock under rules promulgated by the SEC. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in these securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes risks associated with these stocks, broker-dealers&#8217; duties, customers&#8217; rights and remedies, market and other information, and make suitability determinations approving the customers for these stock transactions based on financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing, provide monthly account statements to customers, and obtain specific written consent of each customer. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a penny stock is to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for the stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock and increase the transaction cost of sales and purchases of these stocks compared to other securities.

<section title="planofoperation" desc="Plan of Operation" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">The Company was incorporated in Nevada in February 2021 and spun-off from Singlepoint Inc. in April 2021. Management believes the assumptions made to carve out the Company&#8217;s underlying standalone financial statements from the consolidated Singlepoint results prior to the April 2021 spin-off are reasonable. Nevertheless, the financial statements may not include all the actual expenses that would have been incurred had the Company operated as a standalone company during the period prior to the spin-off. Actual costs that would have been incurred if the Company had operated as a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas.
In August 2023, we achieved our goal of creating a chatbot using AI technology to be placed on CBD retailers&#8217; and brands&#8217; websites. This chatbot is able to answer questions specifically tailored to the CBD industry and can be trained on client specific questions as well as trained to accommodate other industries. In addition to the ability to answer questions, the bot can use answers and customer feedback to recommend a product from the list uploaded by the client.
On August 17, 2023, we engaged AR XTLabs to help in development of an AI chatbot specifically designed for the CBD industry. The chatbot offers CBD and wellness merchants the ability to increase sales by providing product recommendations, track user behavior for inventory management, and ChatCBDW can also provide information on products and education around the clock. Our bot was built on Microsoft Azure by AR XTLabs, a state-of-the-art development company in the AI space. ChatCBDW is a proprietary bot fully integrated with ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. This integration equips ChatCBDW with natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning capabilities, allowing lifelike conversations and intelligent product recommendations. It's designed to drive sales, educate audiences on products, and provide analytics on customer preferences and behavior, contributing to inventory management. The chat technology is enhanced through a patent possible process that tailors product recommendations to merchant specifications.
In September 2023, we partnered with Cool Blue Distribution, a leading CBD distributor, to better expand our CBD expertise and gain access hundreds of retailers and brands. The Company agreed to install the bot on Cool Blue&#8217;s website as the first beta tester of our new chatbot.

These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company&#8217;s principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operating activities, as well as its ability to raise capital. The Company&#8217;s operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and it is uncertain if the Company will be able to become profitable and continue growth for the foreseeable future. If management is not able to increase revenue and/or manage operating expenses, the Company may not be able to achieve profitability. The Company&#8217;s ability to continue in existence is dependent on the Company&#8217;s ability to achieve profitable operations.
To continue operations for the next 12 months, we will have a cash need of approximately $1,000,000. Should we not be able to fulfill our cash needs through the increase of revenue, we will need to raise money through outside investors through convertible notes, debt or similar instrument(s). The Company plans to pay off current liabilities through sales and increasing revenue through sales of Company services and or products, or through financing activities as mentioned above, although there is no guarantee that the Company will ultimately do so.

<section title="evaluationofdisclosurecontrolsandprocedures" desc="Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and, as such, is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Gregory Lambrecht, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Mr. Lambrecht evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2023. Based on his evaluation, Mr. Lambrecht concluded that, due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023. In light of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, we completed substantive procedures, including validating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used for accounting prior to filing this Annual Report.
These additional procedures have allowed us to conclude that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements included in this Annual Report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

</section><section title="internalcontroloverfinancialreporting" desc="Internal Control Over Financial Reporting" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company. Due to limited resources, management conducted an evaluation of internal controls based on criteria established in 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#8220;
COSO &#8221;). The results of this evaluation determined that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2023, due to material weaknesses. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting.
Management&#8217;s assessment identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting:
1.
lack of a functioning audit committee for the entire fiscal year resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control and procedures; and
2.
inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives.
We will continue to follow the standards for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) for internal control over financial reporting to include procedures that:
&#183;
Pertain to the maintenance of records in reasonable detail accurately that fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
&#183;
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and
&#183;
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Despite the material weaknesses in financial reporting noted above, we believe that our financial statements included in this report fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the years presented in all material respects.

<section title="ceo/cfoemploymentagreement" desc="CEO/CFO Employment Agreement" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">On May 10, 2021, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Greg Lambrecht (Director, CEO, and CFO of the Company) to serve as Chief Operating Officer of the Company at an annual salary of $250,000. The agreement provides for a term of three years and will automatically be renewed for additional six month periods unless either party has provided written termination of the agreement at least 90 days prior to the expiration of such term. If employment is terminated as a result of death or Disability, the Company shall pay to the base salary and any accrued but unpaid bonus and expense reimbursement amounts through the date of his death or disability and a lump sum payment equal to one year of base salary (at the time his death or disability occurs) within 30 days of his death or disability. In the event the Company does not have the cash flow to pay such amount within 30 days as set forth above, the Company may make such payments over 12 equal monthly installments. If employment is terminated by the Board of Directors of the Company for Cause (as defined in the agreement), then the Company shall pay to the base salary through the date of his termination and shall have no further obligation to any other compensation or benefits. If employment is terminated by the Company (or its successor) upon the occurrence of a change of control or within six (6) months thereafter, the Company (or its successor, as applicable) shall (i) continue to pay to the base salary for a period of twelve (12) months following such termination, (ii) pay the any accrued and any earned but unpaid bonus, (iii) pay the bonus he would have earned had he remained with the Company for six (6) months from the date which such termination occurs, and (iv) pay expense reimbursement amounts through the date of termination. If employment is terminated by Mr. Lambrecht for Good Reason, or by the Company without Cause, then the Company shall (i) pay a single lump sum cash payment within five business days of such termination equal to six (6) times the then monthly base salary in effect regardless of when such termination occurs (provided, that in the event the Company does not have the cash flow to pay such amount within five business days as set forth above, the Company may make such payments over 12 equal monthly installments), and (ii) pay the bonus Mr. Lambrecht would have earned had he remained with the Company for six (6) months from the date which such termination occurs, and (iii) pay any expense reimbursement amounts owed, and payment for any unused vacation days, through the date of termination.
Effective February 28, 2024, we entered into a new Employment Agreement with Mr. Lambrecht. The term of the agreement is three years from the effective date, and will renew for six month periods automatically unless terminated by either party providing 90 days of prior written notice or for &#8220;Cause,&#8221; as defined in the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Lambrecht is entitled to an annual salary of $250,000. Mr. Lambrecht is also entitled to a bonus as determined by our Board of Directors, healthcare (once established by the Company), reimbursement of expenses, and 20 vacation days per year. Also, as an inducement to enter into the agreement, Mr. Lambrecht was awarded 60 shares of Series B Super Voting Preferred Stock (the &#8220;

</section><section title="compensationphilosophyandobjectives" desc="Compensation Philosophy and Objectives" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">The Board believes that the most effective executive compensation program is one that is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals by the Company and that aligns executives&#8217; interests with those of the stockholders by rewarding performance above established goals, with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value. As a result of the size of the Company, the Board evaluates both performance and compensation on an informal basis. Upon hiring additional executives, the Board intends to establish a Compensation Committee to evaluate both performance and compensation to ensure that the Company maintains its ability to attract and retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation provided to key employees remains competitive.

&#183;
each stockholder known by us to own beneficially 5% or more of any class of our outstanding stock;

&#183;
all our executive officers and directors as a group; and

Unless otherwise specified the address for each of the above is 2425 E Camelback Rd., Suite 150, Phoenix, AZ 85016.
Our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership prior to this offering is based on 62,486,877 shares of common stock outstanding as of April 15, 2024, we also have 56,322,598 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 90 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person or persons, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person or persons (and only such person or persons) by reason of these acquisition rights.

</section><section title="directorindependence" desc="Director Independence" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">We are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be &#8220;independent&#8221; and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority of &#8220;independent directors.&#8221;
We currently have not established any committees of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may designate from among its members an executive committee and one or more other committees in the future. We do not have a nominating committee or a nominating committee charter. Further, we do not have a policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by security holders. To date, other than as described above, no security holders have made any such recommendations. The entire Board of Directors performs all functions that would otherwise be performed by committees. Given the present size of our board it is not practical for us to have committees. If we are able to grow our business and increase our operations, we intend to expand the size of our board and allocate responsibilities accordingly.
