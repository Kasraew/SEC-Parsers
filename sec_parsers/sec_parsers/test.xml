We started by offering a tobacco- and nicotine-free smoking alternative called &#8220;1606 Original Hemp.&#8221; We started to sell hemp, aroma-free cigarettes, first by reselling the star brand, and eventually our own brand called &#8220;TRUZ.&#8221; The brands expanded to include &#8220;Singlez,&#8221; an individually packeted version of the TRUZ hemp cigarettes. This business has been discontinued.&#10;In August of 2023, we decided to use our knowledge of the cannabidiol (&#8220;&#10;CBD &#8221;) industry to move into AI chatbots specifically made for the CBD industry. We partnered with ARXT Labs to create a proprietary Chatbot using AI to answer customer questions and recommend a product based on their answers and preferences. We then signed a distribution contract with Cool Blue Distribution to sell the service to CBD companies as well as offer their CBD expertise through Cool Blue&#8217;s owner, Don Flanagan. In late 2023, we debuted our first chat bot, &#8220;chatCBDW by CBDW AI,&#8221; and began signing up customers to test and implement the bot on their CBD websites.&#10;With our corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona, our executive team experienced in CBD products, and our board&#8217;s knowledge of the technology and AI spaces, we believe we are positioned to become the market leader for AI Bot technology.&#10;We also see the future potential for our chatbot technology to expand beyond the CBD industry to any industry with issues with consumer questions and indecisive over product choices.&#160;This includes the solar, beauty, and auto parts industries among many others.&#10;" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">

          <section title="ourstrategy" desc="Our Strategy" text="The global artificial intelligence market has seen remarkable growth, valued at $428 billion in 2022 and projected to reach $2.25 trillion by 2030. With a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;&#10;CAGR &#8221;) ranging from 33.2% to 38.1%, AI's global impact is undeniable, with as many as 97 million individuals expected to work in the AI sector by 2025, according to fortunebusinessinsights.com.&#10;1&#10;The global CBD market is positioned for exponential growth, and e-commerce is at the heart of this expansion. By tailoring our chat bots to serve this niche, we believe we are well-poised to capitalize on this extraordinary growth trajectory. Our chatbots will empower both our shareholders and business partners to thrive in an ever-expanding market. The global CBD market size was valued at $6.4 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.2% from 2023 to 2030.&#10;2&#10;We plan to contract with retailers and brands using a monthly licensing model. Our licensing model is designed with businesses in mind. It allows companies, particularly those in the CBD industry, to integrate our chatbots into their platforms seamlessly. This approach not only reduces the development burden on businesses but also expedites the deployment of AI-driven solutions, enhancing customer experiences without requiring extensive resources.&#10;" parsing="bold-tag;italic-tag;emphasis;">

It's designed to drive sales, educate audiences on products, and provide analytics on customer preferences and behavior, contributing to inventory management. The chat technology is enhanced through a patent possible process that tailors product recommendations to merchant specifications.&#10;In September 2023, we partnered with Cool Blue Distribution, a leading CBD distributor, to better expand our CBD expertise and gain access hundreds of retailers and brands.

Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided.
