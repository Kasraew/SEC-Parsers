# Experimental Branch

## TODO:
1. ~~test new approach to parsing on something handles tables is good at. get parser working~~
2. Improve toc handling - using tests
3. better names - maybe look up another package for inspiration? e.g. 
4. utils? / _ in front of helper names
5. misc QOL features
6. visualization
7. better github structure 
8. upload to test pypi and update main branch with notice of experimental branch
9. TESTS. I have 1k 10k sec filings from last 90 days on my computer. see how many parse, then dig in to see how well.
* better visualization will do wonders here - maybe make pyqt gui to compare side by side?

Before pushing experimental to main, remember to update jupyter notebooks / stackoverflow answers.

Everything is WIP rn, so structure is fluid. Figure out good naming conventions and how to hide / show functions in packages.
