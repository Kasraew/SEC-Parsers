      "|-|-We may not have future opportunities to participate in take-out programs.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-A substantial portion of our in-force policies have been assumed from state-run insurers and cover losses arising only from wind and hail, which creates a large concentration of our business in wind and hail only coverage and limits our ability to implement our restrictive underwriting guidelines.\n",
      "|-|-|-We have a risk posed by the lack of geographic diversification and concentration of policyholders in Louisiana, Florida and Texas.\n",
      "|-|-|-Our strategy to expand into other states, including Florida, may not succeed.\n",
      "|-|-|-We have exposure to unpredictable catastrophes, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results if they occur.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-Our results may fluctuate based on many factors, including cyclical changes in the insurance industry.\n",
      "|-|-|-Increased competition could adversely impact our results and growth.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-If our actual losses from insureds exceed our loss reserves, our financial results would be adversely affected.\n",
      "|-|-|-The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.\n",
      "|-|-|-The lack of availability of third party adjusters during periods of high claim frequency, or the failure of third party adjusters to properly evaluate claims or the failure of our claims handling administrator to pay claims fairly could adversely affect our business, financial results and capital requirements.\n",
      "|-|-|-If we are unable to expand our business because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results may suffer.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-Our financial results may be negatively affected by the fact that a portion of our income is generated by the investment of our company’s capital and surplus, premiums and loss reserves in various investment vehicles.\n",
      "|-|-|-We may experience financial exposure from climate change.\n",
      "|-|-|-Industry trends, such as increased litigation against the insurance industry and individual insurers, the willingness of courts to expand covered causes of loss, rising jury awards, and the escalation of loss severity, may contribute to increased costs and to the deterioration of the reserves of our insurance subsidiary.\n",
      "|-|-|-Our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry and our ability to expand our business may be negatively affected by the fact that we do not have a rating from A.M. Best.\n",
      "|-|-|-An adverse rating from Demotech may negatively impact our ability to write new policies, renew desirable policies, or obtain adequate reinsurance, which could harm our business.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-We rely on independent agents to write our insurance policies, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\n",
      "|-|-|-We face a risk of non-availability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to write business and our results of operations and financial condition.\n",
      "|-|-|-We face a risk of non-collectability of reinsurance, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n",
      "|-|-|-We use actuarially driven catastrophe models to provide us with risk management guidelines.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-The failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n",
      "|-|-|-The failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations.\n",
      "|-|-|-Maison is subject to an independent third party rating agency and must maintain certain rating levels to continue to write much of its current and future policies.\n",
      "|-|-|-If we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-While we currently qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, and as a smaller reporting company under SEC regulations, we cannot be certain if we take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to these companies that we will not make our common stock less attractive to investors. Once we lose emerging growth and smaller reporting company status, the costs and demands placed upon our management are expected to increase.\n",

      "|-|-|-Our information technology systems may fail or suffer a loss of security which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n",
      "|-|-|-The development and expansion of our business is dependent upon the successful development and implementation of advanced computer and data processing systems. The failure of these systems to function as planned could slow our growth and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",
      "|-|-|-Any failure on the part of our third-party policy administration processor could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our image and negatively affect our financial results.\n",
      "|-|-|-We have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our inexperience as a public company and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\n",
      "|-|-|-We may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\n",
      "|-|-1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n",

      "|-|-|-As an insurance holding company, we are currently subject to regulation by the States of Louisiana, Texas, and Florida and in the future may become subject to regulation by certain other states or a federal regulator.\n",
      "|-|-|-Our insurance subsidiary is subject to extensive regulation which may reduce our profitability or inhibit our growth. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n",
